Multi-award winning, natural history filmmakers David Parer and Elizabeth Parer-Cook have turned their cameras to the sky to capture the spirit of these dazzling birds with breathtaking results - including rare and never before seen footage - all shot in HD.\r\n\r\nVarieties of parrots and cockatoos thrive across Australia and often in large numbers. From the dense rainforests of the tropical north to the cold, wind-swept coast of southern Australia and the arid deserts of the interior. Australia: Land of Parrots explores the spectacular and bizarre behaviour of Australia's wild parrots and cockatoos across the varied landscapes of the island continent.\r\n\r\nIn the tropical rainforests of northern Australia the female Eclectus Parrot defies every rule in the evolutionary rule book. Instead of being drab, like most female birds, she's brightly coloured.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the decade-long drought in the centre of Australia has broken and budgerigars gather to breed. Time is short - they quickly pair up, lay eggs and rear their young, all in the space of a few months.\r\n\r\nParrots are very adaptable, the southern coast of Australia is battered by fierce weather yet Rock Parrots live along the shoreline. Sulphur-crested Cockatoos, Little Corellas and galahs have been quick to take advantage of opportunities arising from modern farming. With food and water easily available, their populations have exploded, causing havoc for farmers.\r\n\r\nOne of the most amazing parrots is the rare Palm Cockatoo which lives up north. Imitating their calls, Steve Murphy has been tracking them for years trying to work out how they live and he's uncovered some amazing behaviour.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION DETAILS:\r\nA film by David Parer and Elizabeth Parer-Cook; Executive Producer: Dione Gilmour",

In Bully, Sundance and Emmy-award winning filmmaker, Lee Hirsch brings human scale to this startling statistic, offering an intimate, unflinching look at how bullying has touched five kids and their families.\r\n\r\nJa'meye, 14, winds up in reform school after pulling a gun on the youths who tormented her for years. Cameras record the abuse suffered by 14-year-old Alex as he's beaten and teased on the school bus. Star athlete Kelby, 16, is ostracised after she comes out as lesbian. Most tragic of all, two boys, one 17 and one 12, commit suicide to escape the torture.\r\n\r\nBully is a beautifully cinematic, character-driven documentary. At its heart are those with huge stakes in this issue whose stories each represent a different facet of America's bullying crisis. Filmed over the course of the 2009/2010 school year, Bully opens a window onto the pained and often endangered lives of bullied kids, revealing a problem that transcends geographic, racial, ethnic and economic borders. It documents the responses of teachers and administrators to aggressive behaviours that defy &quot;kids will be kids&quot; cliches, and it captures a growing movement among parents and youths to change how bullying is handled in schools, in communities and in society as a whole.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION DETAILS:\r\nBULLY is a film by Lee Hirsch.",

She was born into war, but has very little information about her family and why they gave her up. She was only ten months old, when the connections with her mother and motherland were broken. \r\n\r\n&quot;If you think about it too long it could make you cry because it's such, there aren't words that could convey it.&quot; - Sophie English, adoptee.\r\n\r\nThe pain of not knowing and not belonging is deep - it's haunted Sophie for much of her life. She is grateful for the opportunity of growing up in Australia, but something is missing. She wonders about what life might have been.\r\n\r\n&quot;I might've been on the boats fishing, and I would be working really hard like them, but I would have that sense of family. I would probably have grandchildren by now, and I would have that deep need in me fulfilled.&quot; - Sophie English, adoptee.\r\n\r\nAs the fortieth anniversary of the fall of Saigon approaches, Sally Sara travels with Sophie into the Vietnamese heartland to meet a mother who relinquished a child during the war. It's a conversation she has waited years to have.\r\n\r\n&quot;I hope you understand that it's not your fault ... We understand, it was the war and you did your best. We hope that we have done something good in our lives, so that our mothers would feel proud of us.&quot; Sophie English, adoptee\r\n\r\nMore than four decades after she was adopted, she's making peace with her past, but Sophie worries about future children who may be adopted into Australia from overseas.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Government is taking steps to re-open adoptions from several countries, including Vietnam. It's an historic chance to address the trauma and mistakes of the past.\r\n\r\nInternational adoption advocates like Deborra-lee Furness, who speaks to Foreign Correspondent in New York, say it's time to get adoption right. \r\n\r\n&quot;We have to change a whole culture and we have to make people step up and go okay let's do this and you know when we need to do it by? Yesterday. Because every minute that that child is institutionalised or without a forever family they are being damaged.&quot; \r\nDeborra-Lee Furness, Adopt Change.",

In this sumptuous and picturesque new series Silvia takes a journey back to her homeland to introduce her family and present her love of healthy, hearty Italian fare.\r\n\r\nIn episode four, Silvia Colloca ventures to the seaside village of Vasto where she wrestles an octopus in exchange for a delectable seafood salad recipe called polipo con patate (octopus and potato salad). She then pops into Sulmona Markerts, Abruzzo, to purchase the freshest peaches for her spectacular summer dessert pesche al vino con mascarpone (wine-drenched peaches with mascarpone cream). \r\n\r\nContinuing on to her mother's birthplace, Torricella in Abruzzo, Sivlia reconnects with life at its simplest and catches up with her cousin Rosanna who shares her take on a family classic called pallotte cacio e ovo (cheese and egg balls). Then travelling south to Molise, Silvia collects some roadside onions and teams up with her brother to make mouth-watering onion Focaccia.

Through revealing the differences and similarities in the groups approaches' the program aims to develop students understanding of the craft of song writing.\r\n\r\nMusic Moves is a series of nine, fifteen minute music programs for upper primary and lower secondary students developed in consultation with Arts curriculum advisers in the states and territories.  The series aims to develop musical thinking and decision making, with a focus on exploring, experimenting and creating music.  Within this context the programs explore music concepts such as duration, dynamics, pitch, tone colour and structure.  It is not assumed that viewers will have a formal music background, and the programs are intended for use by both the general teacher and music specialist.\r\n\r\nEach program begins with a different starting point for composition, and a presenter, along with young musicians, demonstrates a process for students to follow in creating their own compositions.  Other segments in the programs provide historical and cultural contexts to develop music appreciation and understanding.",

And it's home to one of the last populations of mountain gorillas in the world. Despite decades of civil war and brutal poaching the gorillas are clinging on, protected by rangers who are literally prepared to die for the cause. Every month, a ranger gets killed by a poacher. Now a Belgian Prince has put himself between the gorillas and harm's way, but he's facing a new, more dangerous threat. Big oil is threatening to move into Africa's oldest national park, and they're much more brazen than the poachers.\r\n\r\nTHE COWARD\r\n\r\nIt is the story of our times: young men with a skin-full, randomly attacking innocent people, with catastrophic consequences. Michael McEwen is the victim of a sickening one punch attack, who's surprised everyone with his will to live. But there's another, rarely heard side of the story. Who are these violent young men who leave people like Michael fighting for life, and why do they do it? Well, one of these cowards has now shown considerable courage. Daniel Clementson is brutally honest about what drove him to almost kill someone with just one punch. It's a confronting insight into the mind of an aggressor, when a moment of madness can change lives forever.\r\n\r\nKYLIE\r\n\r\nKylie Minogue has been part of our lives for nearly 30 years. She first burst onto the scene as Charlene in Neighbours, the tough, street-smart girl from Ramsay Street who took the knocks and dished them out. Now at 46, she's a bonafide superstar, one of our greatest ever exports, but there's still a lot of Charlene in Kylie. You see, deep down she's still the girl from the suburbs of Melbourne, and more than ever she's enjoying her return to Australia. Karl Stefanovic sat down with Kylie to reflect on her extraordinary life - some incredible professional highs, and some very tough personal lows. He found a woman of intelligence, beauty who's at peace with her place in the world.",

Go on a private tour of a facility that houses some very precious endangered Aussie animals. And see some slithering snakes milked for their venom and made into an antivenom - a treatment for snake bites! \r\n\r\nSTICKY WOMBATS\r\n\r\nWhat does sticky tape have to do with science and wombats? A lot! Meet Lauren White, a researcher from The University of Adelaide, and find out how putting sticky tape in wombat burrows helps her find out more about these cute creatures.  \r\n\r\nBOILING POINT: THE HOTTEST IN SCIENCE NEWS\r\n\r\nSally Celsius shares her favourite science stories from around the world! This week it's flying snakes in South East Asia, sloths that grow food on their own back, and an elephant that can speak Korean! \r\n\r\nENDANGERED ANIMALS\r\n\r\nTake a look inside a facility that helps to preserve endangered Aussie animals. Trish O'Hara from The University of Queensland takes us behind the scenes of her native wildlife facility to meet some Bridled Nailtailed Wallabies, Julia Creek Dunnarts and Mahogany Gliders. \r\n\r\nMY PET BEARDED DRAGON\r\n\r\nEver wondered what it would take to have a pet reptile? Wonder no more, as Junior Scientist Mason shows off how he simulated a natural environment (complete with heated rocks!) for his pet bearded dragon. \r\n\r\nANTIVENOM LAB\r\n\r\nFind out what goes on inside a lab that is home to snakes and horses! Sam Straniero from bioCSL shows us how he makes antivenom - a treatment for poisonous snake bites. \r\n\r\nPENGUIN RESEARCH FACILITY\r\n\r\nStep inside the Biology Discovery Centre at Flinders University and see why scientists are studying two Little Blue Penguins. Leslie Morrison and Diane Colombelli-Negrel give us the lowdown on their big research project for their little feathered friends. \r\n\r\nGo primal, and join Dr Rob as once again the ordinary becomes extraordinary, under the SCOPE.",

He was just about to chuck them out, when his friend decided to take them home for a second look. Inside were hundred of letters in both English and Italian, pleading for the return of Italian Australian men interned in camps during WWII. A hidden chapter of Australia's WWII history had just come out into the light.\r\n\r\nThe letters tell the story of the hundreds of Italian migrants who were interned in camps and sent to work on projects like the Port August- Darwin railway line. Some were pro Mussolini but many were also vehemently anti fascist. Tensions between the two groups came to a head in one of the camps when an anti-fascist Italian was murdered by a fascist countryman. Securing the release of anti fascist Italians was therefore a matter of life and death. \r\n\r\nCo-ordinating the letter writing campaign was Tom Saviane from the anti fascist organisation Italia Libera. After the war he arranged to have the box of documents hidden, for fear that their political nature could incriminate those named.",

From a beautiful tree house constructed across two large oak trees, Jimmy charts the unfolding of the four seasons.\r\n\r\nJimmy's tree house is connected to high walkways and zip lines allowing him to explore the secret life of the species that dwell there - from the treetops down to the forest floor. The magic of the woodland is brought to life in Jimmy's laboratory - a tree house annex where he delves deeper into the biology, ecology and social history of his forest.\r\n\r\nJimmy invites expert guests to his tree house camp, including bush cook foragers, ecologists, traditional craftspeople, entomologists, living historians and all manner of country folk. When he can't find the answers in his wood, he takes field trips which find him tagging new born red deer calves in the wild.\r\n\r\nSpring is in the air and Jimmy delights in exploring his wood and revealing how the forest is coming to life. He finds out how to get a drink straight from a tree, gets to grips with a woodpecker, squabbles with squirrels and makes himself roadkill badger ham. Jimmy even creates his own 'hands-on' experiments to help him reveal what blue tits and butter icing have in common.

A radio DJ made some hurtful and offensive remarks about the Prime Minister and her family. The DJ has since apologised, but it's sparked a debate about whether freedom of speech should have limits. We'll take a look at the argument.\r\n\r\nCCTV\r\n\r\nSome politicians want to put up more CCTV cameras around our cities. More cameras could make it easier for police to catch criminals, and some say cameras could discourage some crimes from happening in the first place So where does the balance lie, between respecting people's privacy and keeping people safe?\r\n\r\nSCHOOL OF THE AIR\r\n\r\nGoing to school is pretty normal for Aussie kids who live near big cities and towns. But there are some kids who can't get to a school because they live in such remote areas. They can do their schooling from home through something called,  the School of the Air. Tash looks at how School of the Air works.\r\n\r\nDINOSAUR TRACKS\r\n\r\nWe check out some amazing dinosaur footprints that have made their mark on the coastline of Western Australia. These fascinating discoveries can tell us lots about life when dinosaurs roamed our planet. But this great archaeological find could be under threat from new construction.\r\n\r\nTALENT SEARCH\r\n\r\nAt a time of year when most of the nation's top footballers are winding down, Australia's young AFL hopefuls are just gearing up for their shot at the big time. The annual Draft Combine gives youngsters from all over Australia the chance to impress their favourite clubs. But for the first time, some international athletes have joined them.",

It's a sudden death match between two teams with long and noble histories, the Bette Davis Cup Squad and the Fitzroy Fireballs. See David Marr and Jonathan Biggins go 'mano e mano' with Anthony Morgan and Dave O'Neil. Each team has all the usual tools in its kitbag, plus a finals-only Powerplay - the chance to double its points in the game of its choice. Dave's Vichy French accent is worth looking out for as well as some ridiculous rock climbing routes, Korean toilet pigs and the phrase &quot;It's just another dead junkie!&quot;\r\n\r\nRandling, created for ABC1 by Andrew Denton and Jon Casimir, the gentlemen behind The Gruen Transfer, is a game show that hearkens back to the good old days when a point was a point and a team was something worth barracking for.\r\n\r\n Using sporting competition as inspiration and framework, Randling pits ten amazing teams against each other over 27 rounds of bone-crunching combat. All of it hurtling towards the 2012 Randling Grand Final and the presentation of a trophy which has cost the ABC so much cash that from next year, Four Corners will be Three Corners And A Gap.\r\n\r\nWhite-water rafting for the brain, Randling is a show where smart people can be funny and funny people can be smart, where actual knowledge may help you, but just as likely won't. It's a cheeky, surprising show that allows Mr Denton to live up to his hosting motto: &quot;I'm Andrew and I'm not here to help&quot;. \r\n\r\nMostly, Randling is a show where brilliant performers can come to play. And that's play for fun as well as play to win. It's a half hour filled with insight and insults, brilliance and bullshit. We guarantee every episode of will leave you at least 1% smarter and 100% happier.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION DETAILS:\r\nABC Executive Producer is Sophia Zachariou, Executive Producer is Andrew Denton, Series Producer is Jon Casimir.",

It follows the search for an Australian Bollywood star: an unknown who will go on to win the prize of a lifetime - a part in a Bollywood film.\r\n\r\nThe six finalists arrive in Mumbai, the heart of the Bollywood film industry. Mentor and judge, Anupam Sharma, reveals they will have to impress a new panel of Bollywood judges at the end of the week, who will then determine which two of the finalists will be sent home to Australia.\r\n\r\nThe contestants are stretched to their limits as they undergo intensive acting and dance training, ahead of the pivotal public performance. Trained by two of their new judges, the finalists are put through their paces and some struggle to keep up. Later, they visit N.D. Studios, where they meet Emma Brown Garrett, an Aussie actress living the Bollywood dream.\r\n\r\nDuring the week, the finalists are also confronted by the poverty they witness on the streets of Mumbai. At week's end, the six fight for their chance to stay in the competition by performing a group dance routine, and acting before an audience of locals and the three discerning judges. This explosive episode concludes as two contestants are eliminated from the competition.

The patient was a 27-year-old gay New Yorker visiting Sydney. The doctors did not know what caused the disease or how it was spread and they discharged the man back into the promiscuous streets of 1980's gay Sydney. \r\n\r\nRampant is the story of AIDS in Australia, and how our response to the disease - so radically different to that in the USA and other countries with conservative governments - made us world leaders in controlling the virus, which had the potential to become a plague.\r\n\r\nDrawing in a cast of characters from Federal Ministers to nuns to sex workers, Australia forged a radical path in its approach to the disease, tapping into the networks of junkies, prostitutes and practising gay men who were the most susceptible to infection. \r\n\r\nLed by the Minister for Health under the Hawke government, Neal Blewett, Australia undertook several unprecedented and pragmatic steps: it introduced a needle exchange program for intravenous drug users, encouraged open discussion of safe sex, and created the famous Grim Reaper advertising campaign.\r\n\r\nThere was fierce opposition from the religious right, but 25 years after the initial AIDS outbreak, Australia's decision to accept human nature in policy making has saved thousands of lives - especially when compared to the USA where 'morality' has outweighed practicality in dealing with the illness.\r\n\r\nExclusive interviews with journalist and AIDS activist Ita Buttrose, former politicians Neal Blewett and Bill Bowtell, the Reverend Fred Nile, St. Vincent's Hospital doctors and the founding member of the Australian Prostitutes Collective bring 1980s Sydney at the height of AIDS hysteria to life.\r\n\r\nRampant is an epic drama encompassing death, plague, love, loss, grief - and survival.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION DETAILS:\r\nProduced by Chapman Pictures in association with the ABC, FFC, AFC and FTO.",

 "520": "  $aAll Watched Over By Machines of Loving Grace is a powerful, provocative three-part series from celebrated filmmaker Adam Curtis (The Power of Nightmares), which argues that humans have unwittingly been colonised by the machines that they have built, seeing everything in the world today through the eyes of computers.\r\n\r\nEpisode 3: The Monkey in the Machine and the Machine in the Monkey\r\n\r\nThis final episode looks at why we humans find this machine vision so beguiling. It argues it is because all political dreams of changing the world for the better seem to have failed - so we have retreated into machine-fantasies that say we have no control over our actions because they excuse our failure.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of the film is one of the most famous scientists in the world - Bill Hamilton. He argued that human behaviour is really guided by codes buried deep within us. It was later popularised by Richard Dawkins as 'the selfish gene'. It said that individual human beings are really just machines whose only job is to make sure the codes are passed on for eternity.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Bill Hamilton was in the jungles of the Congo and Rwanda to prove his theories. But all around him the Congo was being torn apart by war. The program interweaves these two stories - the strange roots of Hamilton's theories, and the history of the West's tortured relationship with the Congo over the past 100 years.

 "520": "  $aFor some time now, some people living close to wind farms have expressed concern that the noise from the turbines is affecting their health. They say the machines have destroyed their lives, causing headaches, high blood pressure and nausea. Four Corners goes to several wind-farming hot-spots across Australia to meet the people who claim they are simply collateral damage as the nation scrambles to embrace renewable energy.\r\n\r\nStand next to a wind turbine and you quickly realise these are a long way from the old windmills that dotted rural Australia. Standing as high as the Sydney Harbour Bridge, with a blade span of 60 metres, wind turbines respond to consistent breezes to generate electricity.\r\n\r\nRight now wind delivers just two per cent of Australia's energy needs. Now, with the Federal Government demanding that Australia produces 20 per cent of its energy from renewable sources, wind energy is becoming big business. Already there are nearly 1100 wind turbines producing electricity across Australia. If the government is to reach its renewable energy target, that number will need to rise by up to 3,000 units.\r\n\r\nKey parts of the country have been ear-marked for wind farm development. They are regions where weather patterns dictate there will be consistent strong winds. Already South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia have seen major developments take place. New South Wales is the next state where wind energy projects are being planned. For some, these developments will offer big financial rewards. Others close to proposed wind farm sites are concerned about claims that wind farms are making people ill.\r\n\r\nWaubra, in regional Victoria, is an established wind farm location, with 128 turbines so far. Four Corners spoke to several locals who claimed their health had been harmed by the technology. One man told reporter Andrew Fowler that the turbines cause headaches that were so bad he had to relocate from his farm and move into town. In his view he's paying a terrible price:\r\n\r\n&quot;We're refugees in our own country. We're leaving here because of danger, it's no set up or anything, we're being really harmed.&quot;\r\n\r\nBut is there any scientific basis for these claims? Some experts believe it's possible that low frequency sounds, generated by the turbines but too low to be audible to the human ear, could have a health impact.\r\n\r\nOthers say that while people might be getting headaches, it's unlikely their health is being affected by sound waves:\r\n\r\n&quot;If you whip up anxiety, people will generate many of these symptoms. There's fear of the unknown, there's activists creating concern among the population.&quot;\r\n\r\nAnd that raises one of the major questions in this debate: are health concerns being exaggerated by activists who simply don't want wind farms in their backyard? In part, the answer can only come with more peer-reviewed research. A recent Federal Government committee looking into health concerns relating to wind turbines, found that it didn't believe there was sufficient scientific research to make clear connections between poor health and the turbines, and that more research was needed. However, Four Corners has now been made aware of new comparative research that looks at health-related data for people living near wind farms and those living away from them. The research is sure to become a key source of information as local communities, councils and governments make decisions about the location of wind farms in the future.",

Struggling to realise the circumstances surrounding the death of their uncle in South Australia fifty years ago, Nin's Brother follows the journey to bring him home to be buried with his mother and brother in NSW.\r\n\r\nIn 1960, Agnes Coe (Nin) learned of the death of her brother Milton in a mine in South Australia - but the story has always been based on loose facts and unanswered questions. It was rumoured that Milton had been chased down a mine and killed by a local policeman after he started a relationship with the man's white daughter.\r\n\r\nThis story has been passed on from generation to generation, and in 2009, it is Milton's great niece, filmmaker Mary Munro, who makes the journey to South Australia in search of answers. As Mary continues to investigate the family mystery, the story unfolds to be more complicated than ever imagined.\r\n\r\nMary believes that the journey to Port Augusta to bring Milton home will be one of healing and closure for the family. She has always felt an intense love for and connection with the uncle she has never met, and feels it is her role to see him find peace. (Commissioned by SBS) (Documentary) PG CC",

 "520": "  $aIn May 2011 the National Gallery of Victoria (NGV) turns 150. To celebrate, Hannah Gadsby, comedian and self confessed art lover, is off on a rollicking historical ride through the collection of one of Australia's most loved art institutions.\r\n\r\nFrom the NGV's humble beginnings at the Victorian Public Library to the recently refurbished facility on St Kilda Road, Hannah Gadsby: The NGV Story reveals the last 150 years hasn't all been beer and skittles. In fact, the Gallery's 'unofficial history' reads more like a great battle: full of cunning strategies and embarrassing blunders. Wealth, conflict, ingenuity and stupidity all take a role in the story of one of the finest art collections in the world. \r\n\r\nGadsby's expose uncovers the cast of rogues and rebels who have made the NGV what it is today. People like Sir Redmond Barry, the Supreme Court judge who set up the gallery in 1861 is better known for sentencing Ned Kelly to hang; and Patrick McCaughey, the flamboyant director in the 1980's, who is best known for buying, losing and recovering the gallery's most famous painting, Picasso's Weeping Woman.\r\n\r\nWith her trade mark deadpan wit, Gadsby asks the hard questions: How did a gallery in such a far flung colony manage to amass such a rich collection? Which trustee didn't have a beard? Was the head of the gallery school really anally retentive? And what is art all about? \r\n\r\nHannah Gadsby: The NGV Story is an informative historical romp with Gadsby shaking the NGV's skeletons out of the closet!\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION DETAILS\r\nArtscape: Hannah Gadsby: The NGV Story is produced by ABC TV.

 "520": "  $a*Coarse language*\r\n\r\nAn audacious social experiment was carried out at a British market town in Cambridgeshire, where 11 immigrants were temporarily removed from their jobs and the work given to unemployed locals. Since 2004, the town has received 9000 immigrants seeking work, mostly from eastern Europe. But many of the nearly 2000 locals unemployed and claiming benefits, blame the foreign workers for their predicament.\r\n\r\nThe 11 locals recruited to fill the migrants' jobs go into a range of workplaces, including a potato company, an asparagus farm, an Indian restaurant and a building site run by a local landlord. As the British come to grips with their new jobs and discover some not so savoury aspects of them, many of the myths around the subject of immigration are dispelled.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION DETAILS:\r\nPresented by Evan Davies; Produced and Directed by Jaimi West for Leopard Films UK.",

We see a remarkable X-Ray of a bladder emptying and amazing footage of the urinary tract. Adam visits a work site to show a Urine Colour Chart - the chart is used so you can tell if you're dehydrated by the colour of your wee.\r\n\r\nWe demythologise the must-drink-eight-glasses-of-water-a-day belief and discuss the existence of embedded water in food we eat. We also explore the myths that you should wee on a jellyfish sting and that there is a burgeoning market for stolen kidneys. We discuss breaking the seal and stopping midstream, exploding kidneys and how much elephants can wee. \r\n\r\nKarl claims men have to splatter, and that the same reason men splatter is the same basis for the technology that creates ink jet printing. Ruben uses drain cleaner to make flammable bubbles, it's just up to Adam to set them alight before they blow away. Adam explains why some people's wee smells of asparagus while others doesn't.\r\n\r\nA group of Australia's premier performers, including Deni Hines, Iva Davies and The Chaser's Andrew Hansen and Chris Taylor collaborate to produce a moving tribute to micturation 'Wee Across the World'.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION DETAILS:\r\nSeries Producer: Chrissie McIntyre; ABC Executive Producer: Sophia Zachariou.

Through direct and often emotional interviews a new generation of young people reveal how they contracted HIV, how they cope, and the impact it has had on their lives and close relationships.\r\n\r\nIn the modern world, HIV is no longer the immediate death sentence it once was. But surviving the virus is a struggle - a struggle often worsened by the stigma and misunderstanding of others and complicated by lovers.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of the three stories in this film is a love story. The English couple trying for a baby, the South African singer's HIV revelation to her boyfriend, and the American mother and daughter, both HIV positive, and coping with adolescence and exams.\r\n\r\nThe program travels to London, New York and Johannesburg. Love in a Time of HIV is full of rich characters - there are tears, there are tragedies and, through it all, the power of love. This documentary avoids the tired old tales of woe and, instead, paints a portrait of HIV positive people leading fulfilling lives and finding love. These are stories of the true triumph of the human spirit in the face of adversity.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION DETAILS:\r\nRockhopper TV. Executive Producers :Richard Wilson and Anya Sitaram.",

 "520": "  $aHosted by James O'Loghlin, The New Inventors is home to the brightest breakthroughs in technology, innovation and invention.\r\n\r\nDeciding the winner of these three inventions are: designer &amp; inventor Sally Dominguez, inventor &amp; journalist Christine Kininmonth, and wood worker &amp; teacher Richard Vaughan.\r\n\r\nInventions featured on the program: \r\n\r\nMEYHOFFER - by inventor Mark Kelly from NSW\r\n\r\nSurfers want to get the most out of the water, but they have to deal with the conditions on any given day. More time on the wave equals more experiences and having more fun, but sometimes that is easier said than done. If only we had a surfboard that gave us the manoeuvrability of a short board but the weight and buoyancy of a long board. Short boards are fun but you can't really move around on the board or perform tricks, and long boards lack the manoeuvrability to adapt quickly to changing conditions on a wave. \r\n\r\nThe Meyerhoffer is a hybrid surfboard which combines the best of both long board and short board features. The board is made using light weight epoxy technology. The invention is possibly the most radical design innovation in long boarding for a generation. By incorporating elements of a long board and a short board, each section of the board is optimised for maximum performance, ultimately making the design an incredibly complex and refined shape.\r\n\r\nOYSTER SAUNA - by inventor Mike Chambers from QLD\r\n\r\nOysters have been enjoyed throughout history. Current methods of preparing oysters include fresh, steamed, baked, fried or most popularly grilled with flavoured toppings.  These methods have existed for many years and there have been no recent advances in the preparation of oysters. As one of the most relished delicacies today, oysters should be prepared and presented as an exciting experience. \r\n\r\nThe Oyster Sauna is a device to deliver oysters to your restaurant table as well as infusing them with flavours. The invention uses dry ice and a heating element that is placed on a stand. Oysters cook and steam in the sauce, while the sauce aromatics are injected into the room for everyone, including people up to 30 feet away, to smell and enjoy.\r\n\r\nPEG IT - by inventor Ross Merkel from VIC\r\n\r\nThroughout history people have always had problems hammering in their tent pegs. It's enough to ruin a family holiday. There must be a better way to insert and remove tent pegs without parents making fools of themselves in front of their giggling children.\r\n\r\nThe Peg It is a tool to insert tent pegs with ease and to remove them from the ground easily and safely. The hand-held tool incorporates everything you need to insert and remove tent pegs, from a lever hook, to a removal bar, a striker bar and more.",

For this project they've hired an architect who specialises in designing and building oak-frame houses.\r\n\r\nBoth in their 70s, Marjorie and Denys are demanding clients, involved on a day to day basis in every step of the project. Their new dream home will be a modern house made of oak and glass, a combination of contemporary and traditional design.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the construction of the frame is the 'topping out' ceremony. A sprig of oak is fixed to the top of the frame as an offering to the oak tree to thank it for the use of its timber.\r\n\r\nThe Randolphs plan to turn the land surrounding the house into a wildflower meadow and invite the local conservation officer along to give them some advice about how to attract birdlife to the site.\r\n\r\nAfter five months the schedule starts to slip a bit so Kevin lends a hand and starts painting the outside of the house.\r\n\r\nFive years after his first visit, Kevin revisits Marjorie and Denys to see how the green oak house has mellowed.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION DETAILS:\r\nWritten and Presented by Kevin McCloud; Executive Producer: Daisy Goodwin.",

Recovery is possible with love, dedication and for the BiPolar Bears, music.\r\n\r\nThe band started as a free-for-all music project for people with mental illness run by the City of Port Phillip. Fifteen years on and the band has some serious goals. \r\nThey're a good rock outfit who perform regularly around Melbourne's mental health scene and like all musicians they dream of hitting the big time. But they've got a problem. Their lead singer, a recovering drug addict, has recovered, cleaned up and moved on. \r\n\r\nThe band hold auditions but finding a singer with a great voice and a mental illness is trickier than they thought. \r\n\r\nThey select Chloe but when things don't go well they're back to square one. \r\nLuckily for the band bass player Kev takes matters into his own hands... \r\n\r\nAround the drama of finding a lead singer the band candidly share their experience of living with a mental illness with humour. Join the BiPolar Bears as they rock their way to recovery and prove that rock is the best therapy. \r\n\r\nEpisode One - The Auditions \r\n\r\nSeven Days to go to a benefit gig with Tim Rogers and no lead singer. Can the BiPolar Bears find a front man who's got the right voice and a mental illness? (Commissioned by SBS in English) (Documentary Series) (Part 1 of 3) *New Series* PG CC WS",

They discover he has a sleep disorder that prevents his brain from switching on the wake-up button.\r\n\r\nIt has cost the teenager his job and his long suffering mother is relieved to hear it is not Robert's fault when the doctors diagnose a physiological condition.\r\n\r\nMargaret, in her 60s, is a frail arthritic sufferer who can only walk with the aid of a stick. But at night, in her sleep, she gets about briskly, taking herself to the refrigerator and preparing herself a meal without waking, nor any memory of it the next day.\r\n\r\nBut her night time activity leaves her exhausted and puts her at risk of injuring her already frail body.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION DETAILS: Produced and directed by Jeremy Lee Williams and Rachael Oakes for Landmark Films.",

 "520": "  $a* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander viewers are warned that the following program may contain images and voices of deceased persons*\r\n\r\nIn a nation abuzz with talk of the proposed 'education revolution', Voices From The Cape is an inspiring story set in the community of Aurukun. This two-part series for Message Stick documents a genuinely exciting approach to engaging young people from at-risk communities and inspiring them to use their voices again.\r\n\r\nIn April 2007, the community school in Aurukun invited David Vadiveloo to bring his unique 'Community Prophets' training model to engage their students. A filmmaker and former human rights lawyer, Vadiveloo says his model of working with marginalised youth can engage any group of young people in any community in the world. In Aurukun he proposed that not only would his team re-engage students with the school, but those students in his program would create 3 high quality short films for screening at a national youth festival.\r\n\r\nFor six weeks the Community Prophets team, led by Vadiveloo, worked with the community and youth of Aurukun. What transpired during the program was confronting, frustrating and emotionally raw. The young students were pushed to raise their own expectations and ultimately they proved to everyone that if they and their families are involved in the school system, they will display as much gifted and dedicated attention to their education as any young people in this country.\r\n\r\nVoices From The Cape illustrates that the digital revolution is not simply about teaching children how to push the right buttons. Rather, it's about opening children's minds to the idea that these buttons can empower their communities, give them agency in their lives, a voice on the global stage, celebrate their identity, offer new possibilities for employment and, where necessary, bring attention to social issues that need to be addressed.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION DETAILS:\r\nA Community Prophets Pty Ltd production",
