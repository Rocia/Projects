She comes across a photo studio and has her photo taken for her eventual funeral. On the bus ride home, she's startled to see her 70-year-old face is gone and replaced by the stunning face of a young woman. Embracing her new-found youth, MengJun changes her name and starts singing in her grandson's band where she attracts the attention of a record producer - and that's when the real fun begins. This is a Chinese remake of the Korean smash hit comedy Miss Granny.

In this episode, Animal Collective reach Brazil, riding a riverboat deep into nature to soak in the sounds of the river and the locals, and hunt down some of the reasons for the region's rapid destruction. While the band feel like it's a trip of a lifetime, their guide isn't sure they're fully physically prepared to face the demanding climate.

Lynette's husband Paul discovered her body when he returned home from work and has lobbied tirelessly in the years since to have the murder re-investigated. When he joined forces with an old friend, former ABC journalist Bob Wurth, those efforts began to bear fruit. Two years ago a cold case investigation began and vital new leads are now emerging. Australian Story was granted rare access to this ongoing investigation, going behind the scenes with homicide detectives as they search for a breakthrough in the case.

The program examines how authorities over several years failed to comprehend the risk posed by hostage taker Man Haron Monis. This special investigation exposes what went wrong and questions whether Australia is prepared for another terror attack.

=520    $aAndrew Graham-Dixon explores how Russia changed from a feudal nation of aristocratic excess to a hotbed of revolution at the beginning of the 20th century, and how art moved from being a servant of the state to an agent of its destruction. From monuments that celebrate the absolutism of the tsars to the epic Russian landscape as inspiration; from the design and construction of gold and glittering palaces to the minutiae of diamond-encrusted Faberge eggs; and eventually to the stark and radical paintings of the avant-garde, the journey through Russian art history is one of extraordinary beauty and surprise.

=520    $aA team of archaeologists are excavating an ancient village in Cambridgeshire, England known as &amp;apos;The British Pompeii&amp;apos;, that has transformed history&amp;apos;s picture of life in Bronze Age Britain. Inside perfectly preserved roundhouses, the team has discovered everything from Britain&amp;apos;s oldest wheel to swords used in battle. The biggest revelation was proof of technology needed to produce cloth which was never before seen in Britain and proved these villagers&amp;apos; lives were anything but primitive. But behind all the incredible revelations is a mystery. The village is perfectly preserved because it burned to the ground. Was it a terrible accident or a deliberate act of violence? To try and solve this mystery, the team plots the progress of the fire, looks for signs of battle on the swords found around the site and questions if this wealthy village was simply abandoned.

=520    $aThousands of North Koreans cross the border into China illegally every year. Living in perpetual fear of being discovered, with all odds against them, defectors still do everything they can to leave. If arrested in communist Laos, they may be sent back to North Korea to face prison camp or worse. VICE joins a South Korean pastor who has developed a modern-day underground railroad to move defectors from China to freedom and eventual citizenship in South Korea. The most dangerous place in the world is Kashmir's line of control, which partially occupies the Indian state and separates India from Pakistan. Observers in both India and Pakistan believe the decades-old conflict between the two nations could potentially lead to the end of the world as we know it. VICE travels across Pakistan to the contested line of control in Kashmir, pointing out how close a nuclear apocalypse is yet again.

=520    $aIn the five years that separated the end of WWII from the start of the Cold War, the world hoped for lasting peace, but instead found itself on the brink of apocalypse. In May, 1945, a terrible war finally ended in the smoking ruins of the Reich. But for many civilians, the aftermath of the war was even more brutal than the conflict itself. Based entirely on remastered and re-coloured archives, this film details the searing reality of those post war years by compiling unseen Russian, British, German, French, Canadian and American archives, and unique images of daily life.

The result is this award-winning documentary: a terrifyingly intimate and uniquely epic portrait of what has become the biggest story of the decade: the migrant crisis. This first episode begins as hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria arrive in the Turkish port of Izmir.

Over an eight-year period the elusive pair left of trail of fear, destruction and heartache across vast tracts of Australia. They were heavily armed, dangerous and desperate. As Steve Pennells reports, the one thing they didn't count on was their brave victims banding together to hunt them down. Sunday Night examines the investigation into the Gino and Mark Stocco crime spree, which saw them steal, loot and ultimately kill people across the eastern states of Australia.

=520    $aA defining cultural tale of modern America - a saga of race, celebrity, media, violence and the criminal justice system. This documentary revisits it all: the domestic abuse, the police investigation, the white Bronco chase and the trial of the century. Drawing upon more than 70 interviews from long-time friends and colleagues of Simpson to the recognisable protagonists of the murder investigation, to observers and commentators with distinct connections to the story, this provocative documentary is an engrossing and unforgettable look at a tantalising saga. In the turbulent 1960s, young OJ Simpson rises to fame as a football star first for the USC Trojans, then with the Buffalo Bills in the NFL and becomes one of the first black celebrities embraced by the white mainstream.

=520    $aOne of Australia's greatest photojournalists goes on a riveting first-hand journey through an Afghanistan never seen on the news. For almost 50 years, activist artist George Gittoes has stood on the frontlines of the world's most brutal conflicts and borne witness to the best and worst of humanity. Now living in Afghanistan's remote, Taliban-ruled Jalalabad province, Gittoes turns his attention to the lives of the children and outcasts of this war-torn land. He focuses on three gangs of children: the Ghostbusters, persecuted Kochi boys who hawk exorcisms of bad luck and demons; the Snow Monkeys, who sell ice-cream to support their families; and the Gangsters, a razor gang led by a nine-year-old antihero called Steel. With a deeply humane vision that won him the Sydney Peace Prize, Gittoes shows the unseen nature of Afghanistan's politics, culture and society, up close and startlingly personal.

=520    $aThis documentary showcases the story of Donnelly McKenzie and Dianne Appleby. Donnelly McKenzie is a quiet gentleman of Broome who had his humble beginnings working at Streeter and Male and soon became the town's top sorter and grader of pearls. In fact, he was so good that his employer had to share him around with other pearling companies. Donnelly was also a great sportsman, excelling at football, basketball and later darts, all where he competed in many tournaments and sporting carnivals. Donnelly has some charming and some not-so-charming stories, especially those before the 1967 referendum, at which time Broome lived as a segregated community. Later in life, Donnelly became friends with Joe Roe and started a counselling service called Pinakarra that visited prisoners. Now semi-retired, he works two days a week at Pinakarra, and apart from that lives a quiet, retired life with children and grandchildren. Dianne Appleby is from the famous Broome family of the Edgar's. Although she lives a contemporary life, Di values the importance of language and culture. She is a linguist and is a fluent speaker in two languages - her mothers and fathers, Karrajarri and Yawuru. Along with her mother Doris, Di regularly performs the Welcome to Country ceremony at Broome's major events and was instrumental in establishing the Yawuru language classes at the Cable Beach Primary School. Di currently works for the Department of Corrective Services while supporting community organisations and the continuation and strengthening of the local language and culture.

=520    $aSwift Parrot Update&lt;br /&gt;Last year we brought you a story about the swift parrot - one of Australia's most charismatic birds, but also one of its most endangered. Logging and land-clearing have decimated their habitat but conservation biologist Dejan Stojanovic also made the startling discovery of why the parrot numbers were plummeting so rapidly - the deceptively sweet sugar glider was eating them. Mark Horstman returns to Bruny Island in Tasmania to witness their remarkable recovery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tick Allergy&lt;br /&gt;With summer on our doorstep, and the odd barbecue or bush walk planned, we thought it timely to revisit this story: mammalian meat allergy is on the rise in Australia and the surprising cause is a tick bite. Dr Jonica Newby meets Dr Sheryl van Nunen, the clinician who discovered the link, and this story is a must-see if you want the latest tips on how best to remove a tick.

A medieval weapon of war held together with tape alone: a duct tape trebuchet. Can they harness the enormous forces of a full-sized sling to fling things huge and deadly distances?

During their search for rare and uncommon species, they meet with scientists and discover what links all three ecosystems together. Finally, they understand the need to preserve them when climate change and human activity are threatening their very existence.

=520    $aYou'll find it in your supermarket fridge, on sushi trains, and in fish shops all over Australia. Salmon is Australia's favourite fresh seafood and we consume tens of thousands of tonnes of it a year. This fish is not caught in the wild, it's grown and farmed in the waters around Tasmania and is a booming industry. But there's a lot consumers don't know about the making of farmed salmon. Producing salmon is big business and the industry is reaping big profits with plans to turn it into a billion dollar industry within 15 years. Reputation is important and industry players promote their businesses as being open and transparent. But those assurances are being put to the test with controversial plans by the biggest salmon company, Tassal, to expand into a new area, causing strong divisions in the community. Those community divisions have brought attention and our unwelcome scrutiny.

Armed with the results, Morgan attempts to detox, examining what he can do to reduce health risks. Can we truly flush these toxins out of our bodies and still exist in the modern world?

Tonight, Adam begins his culinary road trip in the northern tip of Western Australia, discovering food heroes who are putting community first, and the delights of mud crab and pearl meat.
