<p>Arbitration Case</p>

<p>Barry Baroni, Arbitrator</p>
<h4 align="center"><i>ISSUE</i></h4>
<h4 align="left"><i>THE PARTIES STIPULATED TO THE ISSUE, AS FOLLOWS</i>:</h4>
<p class="continued">&ldquo;WHETHER OR NOT JUST CAUSE EXISTED FOR THE TERMINATION? IF NOT, WHAT IS THE PROPER REMEDY?&rdquo;</p>
<h4 align="center"><i>BACKGROUND AND FACTS</i></h4>
<p class="continued">THE COMPANY OPERATES A REFINERY IN SHREVEPORT, LOUISIANA. IT PRODUCES PARAFFINIC LUBRICATING OILS, WAXES, ASPHALT, GASOLINE, DIESEL, AND JET FUEL. IT RECEIVES SUPPLIES AND DELIVERS PRODUCT BY BARGE, TANK TRUCK, PIPELINE, AND RAILCAR. ON THE DATE OF THE INCIDENT, OCTOBER 17, 2016, GRIEVANT WAS SCHEDULED TO WORK THE 5:00AM TO 1:30PM SHIFT. HIS FIRST ASSIGNMENT WAS TO LOAD A RAIL CAR FROM TANK #98 WITH A PRODUCT CALLED VACUUM TANK BOTTOMS (&ldquo;VTB&rdquo;) &ndash; A SOFT ASPHALT PRODUCT. COMPANY WITNESSES TESTIFIED THAT THE TANK ALIGNMENT WAS SET UP SO THAT TANK #93 (WHICH HELD HARD PEN ASPHALT) WAS NORMALLY LEFT OPEN TO ALLOW FOR EXPANSION, AND IF PUMPING WAS GOING TO BE DONE FROM ANY OTHER TANK, THE FIRST STEP WAS TO ISOLATE TANK #93 TO PREVENT CONTAMINATION. WITNESS TESTIMONY CONFIRMS THAT GRIEVANT ALIGNED THE FLOW IN SUCH A WAY THAT HE WAS DRAWING FROM BOTH TANK #93 AND TANK #98, INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING THE PROTOCAL AND DRAWING ONLY FROM TANK #98. UPON DISCOVERY, MANAGEMENT LEARNED THAT BOTH TANKS RAN UNCHECKED AND THE RAIL CAR WAS OVERFILLED, LEAVING PRODUCT ON THE GROUND AND THE LOADING ARM STILL OVER THE RAIL CAR. LAB RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE RAILCAR WAS OUT OF SPECIFICATION, AND WAS ACTUALLY A MIXTURE OF HARD PEN ASPHALT AND VTB. ACTUALLY, DURING THE INVESTIGATION, GRIEVANT WAS ASKED WHETHER HE WAS MONITORING THE CAR DURING THE LOADING PROCESS. HE REPLIED THAT HE REMAINED ON SITE DURING THE ENTIRE LOADING PROCESS, AND LEFT FOR THE BREAK ROOM WHEN IT WAS FINISHED. PRODUCT MANAGER PERDUE BELIEVED THAT GRIEVANT HAD LEFT THE TRACK LOADING SITE ON THE MORNING IN QUESTION, WITHOUT CLOSING TANK #93. HE THEN INFORMED GRIEVANT THAT HE WAS GUILTY OF TWO INFRACTIONS &mdash; OVERFILLING THE CAR AND CONTAMINATING THE LOAD &ndash; AND THEY WOULD RESULT IN PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE OF A WRITTEN WARNING AND A 100 HOUR SUSPENSION. HOWEVER, HE OFFERED GRIEVANT A &ldquo;SECOND CHANCE TO COME CLEAN&rdquo; AND INFORMED HIM THAT IF HE WAS NOT BEING TRUTHFUL ABOUT THE EVENTS, THAT WOULD BE A SEPARATE OFFENSE, RESULTING IN HIS TERMINATION. GRIEVANT INFORMED MANAGER PURDUE THAT HE UNDERSTOOD, BUT STUCK WITH HIS VERSION OF THE EVENTS. AS A RESULT, ON OCTOBER 21, 2016, GRIEVANT WAS NOTIFIED THAT HIS EMPLOYMENT WAS TERMINATED FOR THREE EVENTS: FAILING TO FOLLOW POLICY &num; 90-N-0945; FAILING TO FOLLOW POLICY &num; 90-N-0908; AND, DELIBERATE FALSIFICATION DURING THE INVESTIGATION. MANAGEMENT REASONED THAT SINCE THE FALSIFICATION OFFENSE WAS SO DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER TWO, AND BECAUSE GRIEVANT WAS GIVEN A VERY CLEAR WARNING, THE LATTER OFFENSE WAS TREATED AS A SEPARATE OFFENSE RESULTING IN TERMINATION.</p>
<p class="continued">A WRITTEN GRIEVANCE WAS FILED, ON OCTOBER 17, 2016, TO NO AVAIL; AND, THE ENTIRE MATTER NOW COMES BEFORE THIS NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR FOR FINAL RESOLUTION.</p>
<h4 align="center"><i>APPLICABLE CONTRACT PROVISIONS</i></h4>
<h4 align="left"><i>ARTICLE II &ndash; MANAGEMENT RIGHTS</i></h4>
<p class="continued">ALL FUNCTIONS, POWER, OR AUTHORITY WHICH THE COMPANY HAS NOT SPECIFICALLY DELIGATED OR MODIFIED BY THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE RECOGNIZED BY THE UNION AS BEING RETAINED SOLELY AND EXCLUSIVELY BY THE COMPANY, AND THE COMPANY MAY EXERCISE SUCH POWER AND AUTHORITY TO MAKE UNILATERAL DECISIONS REGARDING THE OPERATION OF THE BUSINESS AND THE DIRECTION OF WORK FORCES WITHOUT FIRST BARGAINING SUCH DECISIONS WITH THE UNION.</p>
<p class="continued">THESE MANAGEMENT RIGHTS, RESERVED TO MANAGEMENT, INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO THE RIGHT TO ESTABLISH, IMPLEMENT AND FROM TIME TO TIME MODFY REASONABLE POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND RULES RELATING TO EMPLOYEE CONDUCT AND SAFETY, DISCIPLINING EMPLOYEES FOR JUST CAUSE, SUB-CONTRACTING ANY OPERATIONS, CONTINUING, RELOCATING OR ELIMINATING ALL OR PART OF ANY OF THE OPERATIONS, ASSIGNING WORK AND/OR TRANSFERRING EMPLOYEES FOR WORK EITHER TEMPORARILY OR PERMANENTLY&hellip;.</p>
<h4 align="left"><i>ARTICLE XIX &ndash; MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS</i></h4>
<h4 align="left"><i>SECTION 8</i></h4>
<h4 align="left"><i>DISCIPLINARY POLICY.</i></h4>
<p class="continued">PROCEDURE</p>
<p class="continued">THE PROCEDURE FOR DISCIPLINE OF EMPLOYEES IS AS FOLLOWS:</p>
<p class="continued">1 <sup>ST</sup> OFFENSE: DOCUMENTED VERBAL WARNING</p>
<p class="continued">2 <sup>ND</sup> OFFENSE: WRITTEN WARNING</p>
<p class="continued">3 <sup>RD</sup> OFFENSE: WRITTEN WARNING, UP TO 100 WORK-HOUR</p>
<p class="continued">SUSPENSION 4 <sup>TH</sup> OFFENSE: WRITTEN NOTICE OF TERMINATION.&hellip;</p>
<h4 align="center"><i>APPLICABLE PROCEDURES</i></h4>
<h4 align="left"><i>PROCEDURE 90-N-0945 &mdash;</i></h4>
<p class="continued"><i>PARAGRAPH 1.6</i>. &ldquo;THE LOADER/BLENDER MUST VERIFY THAT THE CORRECT TANK SPECIFIED ON THE RAIL LOADING SCHEDULE IS LINED UP, AND ALL OTHER TANKS ARE BLOCKED.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 align="left"><i>PROCEDURE 90-N-0908 &mdash;</i></h4>
<p class="continued"><i>PARAGRAPH 3.7</i>. &ldquo;WHILE PRODUCT IS BEING LOADED INTO RAILCAR, IF THE RAIL LOADER HAS TO LEAVE THE RAILCAR LOADING AREA FOR ANY REASON, THE RAIL LOADER IS <i>REQUIRED</i> TO GET ANOTHER RAIL LOADER TO MONITOR LOADING, OR <i>REQUIRED</i> TO SHUT DOWN THE LOADING PROCESS UNTIL HE/SHE CAN RETURN TO THE RAILCAR LOADING AREA. NO RAILCAR WILL BE LOADING WITHOUT A RAIL LOADER PRESENT IN THE RAIL LOADING AREA TO MONITOR THE LOADING PROCESS.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 align="center"><i>DISCUSSION AND OPINION</i></h4>
<p class="continued">IT IS WELL SETTLED ARBITRAL PRECEDENT THAT MANAGEMENT HAS THE RIGHT AND OBLIGATION TO PROMULGATE AND ENFORCE REASONABLE WORKPLACE SAFETY RULES. ARBITRATORS GENERALLY RECOGNIZE THAT EMPLOYEES ARE OBLIGED TO FOLLOW SAFETY RULES AND PRACTICES, AND THAT MANAGEMENT HAS THE RIGHT TO ENFORCE SAFETY RULES AND REGULATIONS THROUGH THE IMPOSITION OF DISCIPLINARY ACTION. (<i>SEE</i>: ELKOURI &amp; ELKOURI, <i>HOW ARBITRATION WORKS</i>, 6<sup>TH</sup> EDITION, P.1004). ARBITRATORS ALSO FREQUENTLY GIVE EMPLOYERS SIGNIFICANT LATITUDE IN DISCIPLINING EMPLOYEES WHO, FOR ONE REASON OR THE OTHER, HAVE JEOPARDIZED WORKPLACE SAFETY. (<i>SEE</i>: <i>STONE CONTAINER CORP</i>., 91 LA 1186 (ROSS, 1988); <i>UNION TANK CAR CO</i>., 110 LA 1128 (LALKA, 1998); <i>LONE STAR STEEL CO</i>., 48 LA 1094 (JENKINS, 1967); <i>RESERVE MINING CO</i>., 29 LA 367 (KELLIHER, 1957); <i>NU-PLY CORP</i>., 50 LA 985 (HNATIUK, 1968); <i>CHEMETCO</i>, 71 LA 457 (GIBSON, 1978); <i>J.R. SIMPLOT CO.</i>, 68 LA 912 (CONANT, 1977); AND, <i>SYLVANIA ELECTRIC PRODUCTS</i>, 24 LA 199 (BRECHT, 1954)). FOR EXAMPLE, IN <i>UNION TANK CAR CO.</i> (SUPRA.), AN EMPLOYEE WAS FOUND TO BE PROPERLY SUBJECT TO DISCIPLINE FOR &ldquo;VIOLATING A COMPANY RULE REQUIRING EMPLOYEES TO READ FLASHPOINTS ON SAFETY TAGS BEFORE WELDING ON TANK CARS, EVEN THOUGH NO INJURIES OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE FAILURE TO DO SO.&rdquo; IN ADDITION TO HAVING THE RIGHT TO SET CERTAIN PRODUCTION <i>QUANTITY</i> STANDARDS, COMPANIES ARE ALSO ENTITLED TO EXPECT CERTAIN PRODUCTION <i>QUALITY</i> STANDARDS IN THEIR EMPLOYEES WORK PRODUCT. ARBITRATORS HAVE RULED THAT MANAGEMENT HAS THE RIGHT TO DETERMINE IF AN EMPLOYEE'S WORK IS FAULTY, AND TO IMPOSE DISCIPLINE FOR FAILURE TO MEET ITS QUALITY STANDARDS. (<i>SEE</i>: <i>TORRINGTON CO</i>., 1 LA 20 (COURSHON, 1945); <i>PATENT BUTTON CO</i>., 43 LA 1208 (KING, 1965); <i>HOWES LEATHER CO</i>., 71 LA 606 (HEWITT, 1978); <i>KELLOGG CO</i>., 55 LA 84 (SHEARER, 1970); <i>CHAMPION DAIRYPAK</i>, 105 LA 462 (ALLEN, JR., 1995); AND, <i>SOUTHWESTERN BELL TELEPHONE CO</i>., 102 LA 531 (NOLAN, 1994)). FINALLY, IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MANAGEMENT TO INSURE THAT QUALITY CONTROL IS MAINTAINED WITH RESPECT TO THE SALE AND REPUTATION OF ITS PRODUCT. THUS, MANAGEMENT HAS THE RIGHT TO DISCHARGE OR DISCIPLINE EMPLOYEES WHO FAIL TO MEET QUALITY STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE, WHETHER IT INVOLVES DEVIATIONS FROM EXPECTED QUALITY CONTROL STANDARDS OR SIMPLY THE LOSS OF PRODUCT OCCASIONED BY AN EMPLOYEE'S NEGLIGENCE. (<i>SEE</i>: <i>VALLEY STEEL CASTING CO</i>., 22 LA 520 (HOWLETT, 1954); <i>LOCKHEED AIRCRAFT CORP</i>., 31 LA 1036 (MCINTOSH, 1958); AND, <i>S &amp; J RANCH</i>, 103 LA 350 (BOGUE, 1994)). IN THE INSTANT CASE, SPECIFIC VIOLATIONS INCLUDE BOTH SAFETY AND QUALITY CONTROL PERFORMANCE ISSUES, EACH OF WHICH WILL BE EXAMINED IN THE DISCUSSIONS WHICH FOLLOW.</p>
<h4 align="left"><i>EVIDENCE OF SPILL VIOLATIONS</i></h4>
<p class="continued">GRIEVANT'S ASSIGNMENT WAS TO FILL THE RAIL CAR WITH SOFT ASPHALT FROM TANK #98. THE PROPER POLICY PROCEDURE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS LOADING WOULD HAVE BEEN TO FIRST TAKE STEPS TO CLOSE OFF TANK #93. IT APPEARS THAT GRIEVANT DID NOT DO SO. EVIDENCE OBTAINED FROM THE FLOW CHARTS OF THE TWO TANKS SHOWED A CONTINUOUS AND UNINTERRUPTED DRAW FROM BOTH TANKS #98 AND #93 BETWEEN 5:09AM AND 6:17AM. THIS COULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED UNLESS GRIEVANT PUT THE PROCESSES IN MOTION. IN ADDITION, LAB RESULTS OF THE RAIL CAR SHOWED THAT IT WAS CONTAMINATED BY HARD POINT ASPHALT FROM TANK #93. COMPANY WITNESS TESTIMONY ALSO SHOWED THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO REPORTS OF ANY DEFECTS ON THE VALVE FOR TANK #93, AND, IT HAD NOT BEEN REPAIRED. THUS, THE ONLY EXPLANATION FOR THE RAIL CAR'S CONTAMINATION IS THAT GRIEVANT HAD FAILED TO CLOSE OFF TANK #93, IN VIOLATION OF THE LOADING PROCEDURE. ADDITIONALLY, COMPANY LOADING POLICY VERY SPECIFICALLY REQUIRES THAT THE LOADER/BLENDER REMAIN ON SITE WHILE A RAIL CAR IS LOADING. THIS IS ALSO A FEDERAL RAILROAD REGULATION. GRIEVANT TESTIFIED THAT HE BEGAN LOADING AT 5:09AM AND FILLED THE RAIL CAR FULLY AND TURNED THE PUMP OFF IN TIME TO GET TO THE BREAK ROOM TO SEND AN E-MAIL TO HIS MANAGER, MITCHELL PERDUE, AT 5:45AM. EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THIS WAS NOT POSSIBLE, GIVEN THE FOLLOWING FACTS. FIRST, THE DOCUMENTATION ONLY ALLOWS A WINDOW OF 35 MINUTES BETWEEN THESE TWO EVENTS, AND THE TESTIMONY CLEARLY SHOWS THAT A RAIL CAR CANNOT FULLY LOAD IN 35 MINUTES. ALSO, GRIEVANT CONTENDS THAT HE LEFT THE LOADING ARM IN PLACE TO DRAIN WHILE HE WAS AWAY FROM THE RAIL CAR. THIS DOESN'T SEEM POSSIBLE, SINCE, HAD HE DONE SO, THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH &ldquo;DRAINAGE&rdquo; THAT IT WOULD HAVE FILLED THE OPEN SPACE IN THE CAR AND OVERFLOWED ONTO THE GROUND. TO ACCEPT GRIEVANT'S VERSION OF THE FACTS, ONE MUST BELIEVE THAT THE RAIL CAR FILLED IN RECORD TIME MUCH FASTER THAN IT HAD BEEN DONE BEFORE OR SINCE, AND THEN DRAINED A QUANTITY THAT HAD NEVER OCCURRED BEFORE OR SINCE. THUS, IT IS THE ARBITRATOR'S CONSIDERED OPINION THAT THE PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE PROVES THAT GRIEVANT FAILED TO FOLLOW PROPER PROCEDURE, AND THEN FAILED TO ADMIT TO HAVING DONE SO.</p>
<h4 align="left"><i>PRIOR PERFORMANCE INFRACTIONS</i></h4>
<p class="continued">GRIEVANT'S WORK PERFORMANCE RECORD CONTAINS OTHER EXAMPLES OF SAFETY AND PRODUCT CONTAMINATION AND LOSS VIOLATIONS. IN MARCH, 2016, HE RECEIVED A PRE-DISCIPLINARY COACH AND COUNSELING REPORT RELATING TO HIS FAILURE TO PLUG A RAIL CAR OF PRODUCT. TWO MONTHS LATER, IN MAY, 2016, HE WAS ISSUED A DOCUMENTED VERBAL WARNING FOR HIS FAILURE TO ACTIVATE DERAILERS WHILE LOADING PRODUCT. THEN, IN JULY, 2016, HE WAS ISSUED A WRITTEN WARNING FOR FAILURE TO BLOCK ONE TANK WHILE LOADING FROM ANOTHER. THIS ERROR RESULTED IN CONTAMINATED LOADS, AND A LOSS OF &dollar;88,000.00 IN VALUE. AT THAT POINT, HE WAS UP TO A DISCIPLINARY LEVEL WHICH CALLED FOR A WARNING COUPLED WITH A SUSPENSION. EACH OF THESE PERFORMANCE VIOLATIONS DEMONSTRATED GRIEVANT'S FAILURE TO MEET EXPECTED PRODUCTION QUALITY STANDARDS. THEY NOT ONLY JEOPARDIZED WORKPLACE SAFETY, BUT THE PRODUCT LOSS ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED ON QUALITY CONTROL AND THE COMPANY'S REPUTATION.</p>
<h4 align="left"><i>THE OCTOBER 17</i><sup><i>TH</i></sup> <i>INVESTIGATIVE HEARING</i></h4>
<p class="continued">WHEN HE RETURNED TO THE RAILCAR, GRIEVANT REALIZED THAT HE HAD A SPILL AND CONTACTED HIS SUPERVISOR, CLIFTON JOHNSON, WHO CAME TO THE SCENE. JOHNSON TESTIFIED THAT THERE WAS PRODUCT ON THE GROUND AND THE LOADING ARM WAS STILL OVER THE RAIL CAR. SINCE THERE WAS SO MUCH PRODUCT ON THE GROUND, JOHNSON INITIALLY SUSPECTED THAT GRIEVANT EITHER LEFT THE AREA OR HAD FALLEN ASLEEP. HE TESTIFIED THAT WHEN A CAR OVERFILLS, AN ALERT EMPLOYEE ON THE SCENE WOULD STOP THE PUMP IMMEDIATELY. THAT HAD NOT OCCURRED IN THIS CASE. AT THE INVESTIGATIVE HEARING OF OCTOBER 17<sup>TH</sup>, GRIEVANT SAID THAT HE REMAINED ON THE SITE THROUGHOUT THE LOADING PROCESS, AND, WENT TO THE BREAK ROOM ONLY WHEN LOADING WAS COMPLETED. WHEN ASKED WHY HE DID NOT FOLLOW PROCEDURE CALLING FOR THE LOADING ARM TO BE REMOVED AFTER THE LOADING PROCESS WAS COMPLETED, GRIEVANT STATED THAT HE WANTED THE LOADING ARM TO DRAIN. HE FURTHER STATED THAT WHEN THE CAR OVERFLOWED, HE WAS NEAR TANK #93 AND OFFERED NO EXPLANATION WHY HE WAS AT THAT TANK WHEN HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE LOADING FROM TANK #98. MR JOHNSON TESTIFIED THAT HE HAD REVIEWED THE FLOW GAUGES AND THE FLOW OF PRODUCT FROM BOTH TANKS, WHICH INDICATED THAT THE PRODUCT FLOW WAS UNINTERRUPTED AND CONSTANT FROM 5:09AM UNTIL 6:17PM. JOHNSON CONCLUDED THAT GRIEVANT WAS NOT BEING TRUTHFUL AND CONFERRED WITH HIS SUPERIOR, MR. PERDUE, WHO REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD RECEIVED AN E-MAIL FROM GRIEVANT ON THE MORNING OF THE SPILL. A CORPORATE I.T. INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE E-MAIL WAS SENT FROM THE EMPLOYEE BREAK ROOM, 100 TO 200 YARDS FROM THE TRACK LOADING AREA, AND THE GRIEVANT, HAD LOGGED INTO THE COMPUTER AT 5:42AM. SINCE IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO LOAD A RAIL CAR IN 35 MINUTES, PERDUE THEN KNEW THAT, IN ADDITION TO GRIEVANT'S FALSE STATEMENT ABOUT CLOSING TANK #93, HIS STATEMENT THAT HE HAD NOT LEFT THE LOADING SITE WAS ALSO A FALSIFICATION.</p>
<h4 align="left"><i>SEPARATE OFFENSE &ndash; FALSIFICATION</i></h4>
<p class="continued">THE DAY FOLLOWING THE INVESTIGATORY HEARING, GRIEVANT REQUESTED A MEETING AND MET WITH PRODUCT MANAGER PERDUE. HE INQUIRED WHAT PUNISHMENT HE MIGHT BE GIVEN FOR THE RAIL CAR OVERFILLING AND FOR IT BEING &ldquo;OUT OF SPEC.&rdquo; PERDUE INFORMED HIM THAT THE TWO VIOLATIONS WOULD RESULT IN PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE INVOLVING A WRITTEN WARNING AND A 100 HOUR SUSPENSION. BUT HE ALSO WARNED GRIEVANT THAT IF HE WAS NOT BEING TRUTHFUL ABOUT THE EVENTS, THE ITEM OF UNTRUTHFULNESS WOULD AMOUNT TO A SEPARATE OFFENSE, AND WOULD RESULT IN HIS TERMINATION. AS PERDUE TESTIFIED, IT WAS HIS DESIRE TO IMPRESS UPON GRIEVANT THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING FORTHRIGHT ABOUT SUCH EVENTS, AND HE WANTED TO &ldquo;GIVE (GRIEVANT) A SECOND CHANCE TO COME CLEAN.&rdquo; GRIEVANT DID NOT &ldquo;COME CLEAN&rdquo;, BUT STUCK BY HIS VERSION OF THE EVENTS. THIS DELIBERATE FALSIFICATION IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER TWO VIOLATIONS, IN THAT IT INVOLVED A SERIOUS BREACH OF &ldquo;TRUST&rdquo; WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO THE EMPLOYER/EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS FALSE STATEMENTS AS SEPARATE AND DISTINCT OFFENSES, AND TREATS THEM AS SUCH UNDER THE PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE SECTION OF THE AGREEMENT. ARBITRATION CASE LAW SUPPORTS THIS POSITION. ARBITRATORS CONSIDER FALSIFICATION DURING AN INVESTIGATIVE HEARING AS SOMETHING SEPARATE AND APART FROM THE UNDERLYING OFFENSE ITSELF. FOR EXAMPLE, IN <i>FEDEX CORPORATON</i>, 2008 BNA LA SUPP. 119304 (2008), ARBITRATOR VERNON STATED, &ldquo;&hellip;TRUST IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE EMPLOYMENT (RELATIONSHIP)&hellip;. LYING IN AN INVESTIGATION CAN RISE TO AN INDEPENDENT OFFENSE, SEPARATE AND EVEN MORE SERIOUS THAN THE UNDERLYING BEHAVIOR.&rdquo; (<i>SEE, ALSO</i>: <i>U.S. STEEL CORP</i>., 2010 BNA LA SUPP. 119076 (DAS, 2010) (EMPLOYEE TERMINATED FOR COMMITTING TWO SERIOUS OFFENSES: USE OF THREATENING LANGUAGE AND PROVIDING FALSE INFORMATION DURING (AN INVESTIGATION); <i>AK STEEL CORP</i>., 132 BNA LA 158 (SKULINA, 2013) (TERMINATION) FOR COMMITTING TWO OFFENSES: VIOLATING SAFETY RULE REQUIRING WEARING OF FACE SHIELD AND LYING DURING EMPLOYER'S INVESTIGATION); AND, <i>EMPLOYER AND IBEW</i>, 2015 BNA LA SUPP. 193941) (FEIGENBAUM, 2015) (GRIEVANT TERMINATED FOR SAFETY VIOLATION OF JAMMING DEAD MAN SWITCH IN OPEN POSITION AND LYING DURING THE INVESTIGATION)). THUS, IN THE INSTANT CASE, GRIEVANT'S FALSIFICATION AT THE INVESTIGATION WAS A SEPARATE AND DISTINCT ACT OF MISCONDUCT ON HIS PART, AND THERE IS COMPELLING REASON TO TREAT IT AS A SEPARATE OFFENSE, WITH SEPARATE DISCIPLINARY CONSEQUENCES.</p>
<h4 align="left"><i>PROPRIETY OF THE DISCIPLINE</i></h4>
<p class="continued">IN THE INVESTIGATORY HEARING, THERE IS A NEED TO CONDUCT A &ldquo;ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS&rdquo; TO DETERMINE WHETHER PROCESSES OR PROCEDURES REQUIRE MODIFICATION, OR WHETHER EQUIPMENT IS MALFUNCTIONING. AND, THIS REQUIRES COMPLETE CANDOR AND TRUTHFULNESS ON THE PART OF ANY EMPLOYEE INVOLVED. IN THIS CASE, GRIEVANT WAS SPECIFICALLY WARNED AT THE INVESTIGATION THAT TRUTHFULNESS WAS ESSENTIAL AND THAT LYING AT THE HEARING WOULD BE TREATED MORE SERIOUSLY AND WILL RESULT IN TERMINATION. IN EFFECT, PRODUCT MANAGER PERDUE WAS OFFERING GRIEVANT A &ldquo;LAST CLEAR CHANCE&rdquo; TO BE TRUTHFUL AND TO CONVINCE MANAGEMENT THAT IT SHOULD EXTEND HIS EMPLOYMENT AND CONTINUE ENTRUSTING THE LOADING OF COMPANY PRODUCTS TO HIM. HOWEVER, THROUGH HIS DELIBERATE REFUSAL TO TELL THE TRUTH AND TO ADMIT HIS VIOLATIONS, GRIEVANT REFUSED THIS LAST CLEAR CHANCE AND GAVE MANAGEMENT NO REASON TO EXTEND HIS EMPLOYMENT.</p>
<h4 align="left"><i>CONCLUSION</i></h4>
<p class="continued">THE EVIDENCE IS CLEAR THAT GRIEVANT CAUSED THE SPILL BY NOT CLOSING TANK #93 AND BY FAILING TO PROPERLY LINE-UP THE CONNECTIONS TO FILL THE RAIL CAR FROM TANK #98. THIS RESULTED IN A RAIL CAR FULL OF CONTAMINATED PRODUCT. THE EVIDENCE IS ALSO CLEAR THAT GRIEVANT'S FAILURE TO REMAIN AT THE RAIL SITE WHILE THE CAR WAS LOADING, RESULTED IN THE CAR FILLING WELL ABOVE THE CUT-OFF POINT AND OVERFLOWING TO THE GROUND. THE SPILL CAUSED THE RAIL CAR TO BE &ldquo;OUT OF SPEC,&rdquo; RESULTING IN BOTH SAFETY AND QUALITY CONTROL STANDARD VIOLATIONS (<i>SEE</i>: <i>UNION TANK CAR</i>, SUPRA). GRIEVANT'S <i>GROSS NEGLIGENCE</i> IN NOT REMAINING AT THE LOADING SITE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE LOADING PROCESS WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCT LOSS. (<i>SEE</i>: <i>VALLEY STEEL CASTING CO</i>., SUPRA.). THESE TWO PERFORMANCE INFRACTIONS WERE, INDEED, VERY SERIOUS VIOLATIONS. THEY WERE NOT ONLY IN VIOLATION OF SPECIFIC COMPANY RAIL CAR LOADING PROCEDURES, BUT, ALSO IN VIOLATION OF FEDERAL RAILROAD REGULATIONS. YET, THE COMPANY OFFERED GRIEVANT A &ldquo;WAY OUT&rdquo; OF HIS DILEMMA BY SIMPLY ADMITTING HIS FAULT AND ACCEPTING A WRITTEN WARNING AND A 100 HOUR SUSPENSION, IN LIEU OF TERMINATION. COMPANY PRODUCT MANAGER PERDUE SPECIFICALLY WANTED TO REMIND GRIEVANT OF THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING TRUTHFUL, IN ORDER TO KEEP HIS JOB. HE WANTED TO GIVE GRIEVANT A &ldquo;FINAL&rdquo; CHANCE TO PROVE TO MANAGEMENT THAT HE COULD BE TRUSTED WITH COMPANY PRODUCT, IN THE FUTURE. THUS, THE COMPANY TREATED TRUTHFULNESS DURING THE INVESTIGATION AS A SEPARATE OBLIGATION, AND, PERDUE PLACED GRIEVANT ON NOTICE THAT NON-ADMISSION OF FAULT WOULD AMOUNT TO A THIRD OFFENSE AND RESULT IN TERMINATION. EVEN THOUGH HE WAS WARNED BY HIS MANAGER OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT ADMITTING TO FALSE AND MISLEADING INFORMATION, GRIEVANT REFUSED TO CHANGE HIS POSITION, AND WAS PROPERLY TERMINATED. THUS, <i>IT IS THE ARBITRATOR'S CONSIDERED OPINON THAT JUST CAUSE EXISTED FOR THE TERMINATION</i>.</p>
