<p>IN THE MATTER OF ARBITRATION between Jefferson County-DuBois Area Vocational-Technical School Committee and Jefferson County-DuBois Area Vocational Technical Association, PSEA/NEA</p>
<p>Arbitration Case</p>
<p>BOM Case: 2016-0349</p>
<p>May 17, 2017.</p>
<p>John M. Felice, Arbitrator</p>
<h4 align="center"><i><b>NATURE OF THE GRIEVANCE</b></i></h4>
<p class="continued">The undersigned Arbitrator was selected by the parties to hear and decide a matter in dispute between Jefferson County-DuBois Area Vocational-Technical School Committee, hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;Committee&rdquo;, and Jefferson County-DuBois Area Vocational Technical Association, PSEA/NEA, hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;Association&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The dispute is properly before the Arbitrator in accordance with the Collective Bargaining Agreement, hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;CBA&rdquo;, between the parties.</p>
<p>On November 15, 2016, a hearing was held in DuBois, PA, at which time a full opportunity to introduce evidence and examine and cross-examine witnesses was afforded to both parties. Post hearing briefs were filed by the parties on March 29,2017.</p>
<h4 align="center"><i><b>ISSUE I</b></i></h4>
<p class="continued">Was the reprimand of Mary Meredith (hereinafter the &ldquo;Grievant&rdquo;) proper? If not, what shall be the remedy?</p>
<h4 align="center"><i><b>ISSUE II</b></i></h4>
<p class="continued">Was the Employee Improvement Plan issued to the Grievant proper? If not, what shall be</p>
<p class="continued">the remedy?</p>
<h4 align="center"><i><b>ISSUE III</b></i></h4>
<p>Was the three (3) day suspension of the Grievant for just cause? If not, what shall be the remedy?</p>
<h4 align="center"><i><b>BACKGROUND</b></i></h4>
<p>The Association, on behalf of the Grievant, filed three grievances. The Association and the Committee agreed to arbitrate all three grievances before the undersigned Arbitrator.</p>
<p>Grievance 1 involved a written reprimand which was issued to the Grievant on April 7, 2016, accompanied by an Employee Improvement Plan. A grievance was filed alleging a violation of the CBA, particularly Articles 3, 6 and 8 thereof. The Association requests that the grievance be sustained and that the written reprimand issued April 7, 2016 be expunged from the personnel file of the Grievant and the Employee Improvement Plan implemented on April 14, 2016 be invalidated.</p>
<p>Grievance 2 was filed on May 24, 2016 and alleges that Superintendent Barry Fillman (&ldquo;Fillman&rdquo;) and Principal Melissa Mowrey (&ldquo;Mowrey&rdquo;) did not have just cause to reprimand the Grievant involving her disputed classroom rules in the doorway of her classroom with her students being present. The Association claims the Grievant suffered humiliation at the hands of her students telling her that classroom rules were out and they need not be followed. An Employee Improvement Plan was also issued at the same time. The Association contends the Committee did not have just cause to issue said plan. The Association requests that this grievance be sustained.</p>
<p>In Grievance 3, the Association alleges that the Committee did not have just cause to suspend the Grievant for three (3) days without pay for insubordination. Thus, the Committee violated Article 6 of the CBA. The Association requests that the grievance be sustained and the Grievant be made whole.</p>
<p>All three grievances were denied by the Committee. When the parties were unable to resolve the grievances they agreed to consolidate all three grievances to be heard by the undersigned arbitrator for final and binding disposition.</p>
<h4 align="center"><i><b>PERTINENT CONTRACT PROVISIONS</b></i></h4>
<blockquote><p class="continued"><b>Article 6 &ndash; Professional Behavior.</b> &ldquo;No employee shall be dismissed, disciplined, reprimanded, reduce in rank or compensation without just cause&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="continued">&ldquo;<b>Article 8, Grievance Procedure, Section 6.</b> &ldquo;The Arbitrator shall be without power or authority to make any decision which requires commission of an act prohibited by law, or which is in violation of the terms of this agreement. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<h4 align="center"><i><b>CONTENTIONS OF THE PARTIES</b></i></h4>
<p>The Association contends that the Committee did not have just cause to issue a written reprimand and an Employee Improvement Plan. The Association also contends that the Committee improperly reprimanded the Grievant concerning the adoption of her classroom rules in the doorway of her classroom with students present. Further, the Association contends that the Committee did not have just cause to suspend the Grievant for three (3) days for insubordination. Accordingly, the Association requests that the grievances be sustained and that the Grievant be made whole.</p>
<p>The Committee contends that it reserved the right to impose the written reprimand on the Grievant based on her unprofessional conduct and behavior and for her refusal to comply with a legitimate administrative directive. The Committee further contends that the Grievant unilaterally implemented classroom rules which she was directed not to implement by the Administration. The Committee contends that the Grievant's action constituted a disregard of an administrative directive, bordering on insubordination. Therefore, the Committee had just cause to impose the suspension. Accordingly, the Committee requests the instant grievances be denied.</p>
<h4 align="center"><i><b>FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS</b></i></h4>
<p>The Grievant has been employed as a professional employee of the Committee for seven (7) years. She taught various math courses including Algebra II during the 2015-16 school year. The Grievant was assigned to teach Algebra II. She was assisted in the classroom by an Aide, Denise McGarvey (&ldquo;McGarvey&rdquo;).</p>
<p>In early April 2016, the Grievant was informed by Mowrey that she had received a complaint from a parent about alleged abuse in the classroom toward her child. Mowrey set up a meeting after school with Fillman and the Grievant to discuss the allegations and prepare for a meeting scheduled for the following day, which would include the student and his parents.</p>
<p>Mowrey had investigated the claim of abuse and found it to be unsubstantiated. The Grievant, and the Administrators then discussed what would take place the following day. The Grievant was under the understanding that the meeting was about the accusation of abuse, and they had planned to bring the student to the meeting because Mowrey believed it would be more difficult for the student &ldquo;to lie with everybody there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On April 6, the Grievant attended a meeting with Fillman, Mowrey, the student, his mother, stepfather and siblings. Throughout the meeting, the mother kept reiterating the alleged abuse, which is a very serious charge. In unrebutted testimony, the administrators remained silent, offered no support to the Grievant and failed to refute the mother's claim of abuse, notwithstanding the fact that Mowrey had investigated the matter and previously stated to the Grievant that she found the claim to be unsubstantiated. Significantly, the Administrators failed to indicate in the meeting that they previously informed the student's mother that the investigation into her claim of abuse proved to be unfounded. Finally, the mother also stated that she felt her son was not safe in the Grievant's classroom. The Grievant became quite upset and emotional over the entire incident and was asked by the Administrators on three (3) occasions to calm down.</p>
<p>As a result of the Grievant's outbursts, the Committee argues that the behavior was unprofessional and it had just cause to issue a written reprimand. The Grievant was understandably upset since she felt the need to defend herself against false accusations while the Administrators remained silent. The Grievant testified that the mother's utterances really alarmed her.</p>
<p>The Committee also argues that the Grievant's actions in the meeting towards the parent was inappropriate, unprofessional and violated District Policy No. 248 which governs Unlawful Harassment.</p>
<p>After reviewing the testimony, the Grievant's action in the meeting did not constitute Unlawful Harassment nor can it be considered an affront to authority. The Grievant's actions merely represented a display of anger toward the student's mother and her displeasure with the Administrator's failure to support her position in the meeting. The Grievant's actions were not a reflection on her professionalism but was a reaction to a rather stressful situation involving a serious allegation.</p>
<p>The issuance of the Employee Improvement Plan is troubling since the Administrators never observed the Grievant teaching during the school year prior to imposing the plan nor did they complete any performance evaluation of the Grievant. There is no causal relationship between allegations of abuse during the April 6th meeting and the Grievant's effectiveness as an educator, particularly since it contains numerous references to the Grievant's lesson plans. Her lesson plans have never been scrutinized or the subject of controversy in the past.</p>
<p>With respect to Grievance 2, McGarvey testified, unrebutted, that throughout the years she has been employed that anyone speaking in the doorway outside the classroom would not be able to be heard by anyone in the classroom. This discussion in the hallway cannot be considered disciplinary. Further, no evidence was adduced to confirm that the Grievant was reprimanded in front of her students with respect to her classroom rules.</p>
<p>With respect to Grievance 3 it is clear on the record that the Grievant encountered behavioral issues from a group of students. Testimony reveals that other teachers encountered behavioral issues with the same group of students. Further, in unrebutted testimony when those disruptive students were not present in the Grievant's classroom, the Grievant gained control over her students.</p>
<p>The genesis of the issue in Grievance 3 centers specifically on the Grievant's implementation of classroom rules which were intended to primarily handle disruptive students.</p>
<p>On May 4, 2016, the Administration advised the Grievant not to implement the classroom rules which were labeled as &ldquo;Mrs. Meredith's classroom rules.&rdquo; The Administration stated that said rules were &ldquo;ridiculous&rdquo; and &ldquo;draconian in nature&rdquo; and that suspending students from class and sending them to the office, unsupervised, would not be allowed. The Administrator's cautioned the Grievant not to implement the rules for this reason.</p>
<p>In preparing for the start of the 2016 school year, the Grievant, on August 1, 2016, sent a memo to Fillman stating that she wanted to provide a written document for students detailing her classroom rules. She indicated that &ldquo;late last year you denied my rules, but never indicated if that meant some of them or all.&rdquo; She then requested clarification before she did her write-up for the 2016 school year. The Grievant received no response from the administration.</p>
<p>Based on an internal investigation, the Administration discovered that on or about August 30, 2016, the Grievant implemented the identical rules in her classroom for which the Administration specifically directed her not to handout to the students in May 2016.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding that the Grievant attempted to discuss her classroom rules with Fillman and wanted clarification about the classroom rules that she had previously implemented, she received no response even though the email was sent to Fillman a month prior to the start of the school year. On two occasions, once in May and once in August, the Grievant requested clarification but received no response from the Administration as to what rules she should modify or delete.</p>
<p>Neither Mowrey nor Fillman sought to remediate the situation to enable the Grievant to implement her classroom rules. A review of Mowrey's testimony confirms that she told the Grievant that &ldquo;classroom management is her professional responsibility&rdquo; yet at the same time ignored the Grievant's attempts to seek clarification of her classroom rules, to meet her obligations as a professional educator in the classroom, and to curtail the undesirable behavior of certain students in her classroom. Clearly these disruptive students needed strict direction to avoid disrupting the entire class.</p>
<p>What is troubling to this Arbitrator is that no discussion ensued between the Administration and the Grievant with respect to the implementation of her classroom rules. It is obvious that the Administrator's received the rules and reviewed them prior to the Loudermill Hearing, since they concluded the rules were &ldquo;ridiculous&rdquo; and &ldquo;draconian in nature&rdquo;. However, no effort was made by the Administrators to resolve the rules prior to the Loudermill hearing which took place in September 2016. Following the Loudermill hearing, the Administrators finally met with the Grievant and concluded that 9 of the 11 rules were deemed acceptable. The Grievant assumed the matter was settled. However, one week after the Loudermill Hearing, the Committee suspended the Grievant for three (3) days without pay for insubordination.</p>
<p>In order to bolster its case, the Committee asserts that the Grievant's actions constitute a violation of Section 1122 of the Public School Code of 1949, as amended. However, after reviewing the overall record in the instant case, there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the actions of the Grievant violated Section 1122 of said Code.</p>
<p>In determining whether the Grievant's conduct rises to the level of insubordination, arbitrators generally consider whether an order was clearly given, whether the employee was made aware of the consequences of a failure to obey the order and whether the discipline is commensurate with the magnitude of the misconduct. The record reveals that the Grievant was given an order but was not forewarned that she would be disciplined if she failed to comply with the order.</p>
<p>In the instant case, culpability exists on both parties. The action of the Committee, particularly ignoring the Grievant's request to resolve the rules, left the Grievant with no alternative but to implement the rules to maintain classroom control, which the Administration stated in testimony was her professional responsibility. The Administration had sufficient time to resolve the disputed rules but they failed to do so. The rules were not overly complicated, particularly since 9 out of the 11 rules were deemed acceptable by the Administration.</p>
<p>In the instant case, the imposition of the suspension violated a basic tenet of progressive discipline which is inherent in the principle of just cause. The Employer should refrain from issuing a more severe penalty until it has been established that the Employee will not respond to a lesser penalty. The fundamental purpose of progressive discipline is designed to correct behavior, not to punish employees.</p>
<h4 align="center"><i><b>AWARD</b></i></h4>
<p>On the basis of the foregoing and after considering the facts and evidence submitted in the instant case, and the arguments proffered by the parties in their respective post-hearing briefs, Grievance 1 is sustained and the written reprimand issued to the Grievant on April 7, 2016 shall be expunged from the Grievant's personnel file. The Employee Improvement Plan which accompanied the written reprimand is not relevant to the disposition in the instant case, therefore, the Arbitrator renders no decision involving said Plan. Grievance 2 is denied. Grievance 3 is sustained in part and denied in part. The three (3) day suspension shall be reduced to a written warning which shall be placed in the Grievant's personnel file. All references to the suspension shall be removed from the Grievant's personnel file. The Grievant shall be reimbursed for three (3) days of pay at her applicable rate.</p>
