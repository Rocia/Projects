<p>IN THE MATTER OF THE ARBITRATION between FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPARTMENT Charging Party, and DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPARTMENT Employer</p>
<p>Arbitration Case</p>
<p>FMCS CASE NO.: 10-03158-A</p>
<p>Edward J. Gutman, Arbitrator</p>
<h4 align="center"><i>BACKGROUND</i></h4>
<p>This is an appeal to arbitration from a Decision of the District of Colombia Metropolitan Police Department on a Group Grievance filed February 20, 2009, by the FOP. The undersigned Arbitrator was selected by the parties in accordance with the rules of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service and conducted a hearing on October 13, 2016 to determine the merits of the grievance. Witnesses testified under oath; were subject to cross examination, and the parties filed scholarly post-hearing briefs in support of their positions.</p>
<h4 align="center"><i>THE FACTS</i></h4>
<p>Pope Benedict XVI traveled to Washington, DC for a planned visit during the period Tuesday, April 15, 2008 through Friday, April 18, 2008. On March 28, 2008, MPD issued a Teletype alerting &ldquo;&lsquo;THE FORCE&rsquo;&rdquo; the Pope would be visiting Washington; would participate in several parades and celebrate a Mass at the National Stadium on April 17, 2008. &ldquo;In order to meet the manpower requirements for this event&rdquo; the teletype activated certain civil disturbance units. On April 8, 2008, affected members were notified their duty hours for the period of the Pope's visit were changed from 0630-1500 hours to 1000-1830 hours. Members on a &ldquo;power-shift&rdquo; schedule, who were originally scheduled to work from 1800 to 0230 hours, were notified on April 9, 2008, that beginning April 17, 2008, their hours and duty schedule were changed to the new hours of 1400-2230 hours.</p>
<p>On May 6, 2008, an Informal Grievance was presented to the MPD Seventh District Commander charging MPD's schedule changes were made without a fourteen-day notice requirement of the parties' CBA for schedule changes. The informal grievance was denied February 18, 2009. Following the denial, the FOP proceeded &ldquo;forward with a Step One Group Grievance &hellip; pursuant to Article 4, 24 and 30 of the Agreement and <i>D.C. Code section 1-612-01</i>.&rdquo; (The emphasis is mine.) The Step One Grievance was denied March 4, 2009. The reason given was &ldquo;Any changes in reporting times would have been directed through the authority of Special Operations Division to ensure the safety of the Pope and all persons involved with this historic event.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FOP moved the Grievance to Step Two March 11, 2009</p>
<h4 align="center"><i>The Grievance</i></h4>
<p>&ldquo;In April 2008, during the week of the Papal (Pope Benedict XVI) visit to Washington, D.C. the Group was scheduled to work from Thursday, April 17, to Sunday, April 20, 2008. The schedule was posted reflecting the Group working the 0630-1500 hours' tour of duty. On April 8, 2008, Sergeant &hellip; notified the affected members the hours and the tours of duty were changed from 000-1500 to 1000-1830 hours. The change was made without the required 14-days' notice &hellip; Articles 4 and 24, were violated when MPD violated D.C. Code Section 1-612-01, by changing the working hours in each day in the basic workweek.&rdquo; Under the heading &ldquo;Manner in which the provisions were purported to have been violated, misapplied, or misinterpreted&rdquo; the Grievance asserted the D.C. Code section was violated by &ldquo;changing the working hours in each day in the basic workweek.&rdquo;<ftnote num="1"><para>The Group on whose behalf the grievance was filed also included CDU Platoon 74 and <quote>similar or identical violations with other CDU Platoons, where hours, tours of duty were changed without the required 14-days' notice.</quote></para></ftnote></p>
<p>The remedy sought was &ldquo;compensate each affected member with overtime at the rate of time and one half for the entire amount of reported hours worked&rdquo; and MPD desist from violating the D.C. Code and the Agreement.<ftnote num="2"><para>As discussed below, the Grievance did not raise or discuss whether a <quote>seriously handicapping event</quote> had been declared as justification for the schedule changes.</para></ftnote></p>
<p>Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier denied the Group Grievance at Step 2 March 18, 2009, ruling &ldquo;With regard to working different tour of duty during the workweek, the provisions of DC Official Code Section 1-612-01 do not apply when the Mayor determines that an organization would be &lsquo;seriously handicapped&rsquo; in carrying out its function or that costs would be substantially increased. The Mayor has delegated his authority to me and I exercised that authority through the issuance of the teletype.<ftnote num="3"><para>There was no evidence submitted by the Department that the Mayor had delegated authority to the Chief.</para></ftnote>The members were scheduled to work the most appropriate tours of duty for the efficiency of the Department.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the issue of a remedy for changing members' tours of duty with less than 14 days' notice, the Chief disagreed with the &ldquo;assertion that members should be compensated at a rate of time and one half for the entire number of regular hours worked.&rdquo; She denied the grievance &ldquo;<i>in part</i>&rdquo; but since the hours had been changed with less than Article 24 fourteen days' notice, the Chief agreed members should be compensated at a rate of time and one-half for any hours worked outside of the scheduled hours since they were changed with less 14 days' notice. She forwarded the matter to payroll for resolution</p>
<p>This arbitration followed 8 years later.</p>

<p class="continued">Section 2. &ldquo;&hellip; The Chief or his/her designee may suspend Section 1 on a Department wide basis or in an operational unit of a declared emergency, for crime, or for an unanticipated event.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 align="center"><i>THE ISSUE</i></h4>
<p>Upon the opening of the record in the Arbitration hearing, Union Counsel proposed the issues &ldquo;were framed&rdquo; by the Step 1 Group Grievance, which read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether MPD violated Article 4 (Management rights) and 24 (Scheduling) when MPD changed the 7D Group Grievants' work schedules from April17, 2008 to April 20, 2008.&rdquo;<ftnote num="5"><para>In response to the Arbitrator's question: <quote>Do I have the authority to decide whether or not there's been a contract violation on any dates other than these dates in 2008,</quote> Union counsel replied: <quote>No, the matter before you concerns is (sic) April 2008.</quote> (Tr. 24)</para></ftnote></p>
<p>The Union's Post Hearing Brief expressed issues to be:</p>
<ol type="digit" bind-char="period" bind-to="right-only">
<li><p>Whether MPD demonstrated that it would be seriously handicapped in carrying out its functions or that its costs would be substantially increased if it did not suspend the workweek rules set forth under the parties' contract and D.C. Code &sect;1-612.01? If not, what should be the remedy?</p></li>
<li><p>Whether MPD compensated the affected members at the rate of time-and-one-half for the hours worked outside of the members' originally scheduled tours of duty from April 17, 2008 through April 20, 2008?</p></li></ol>
<p>In its post-hearing brief the Agency expressed the issues as:</p>
<blockquote><p class="continued">Whether Seventh District members who had schedule changes with less than a 14-day notice, should be paid at a rate of time and one-half for hours worked outside of their regularly scheduled tours; or, whether they should be paid at the rate of time and one-half for all hours worked during their tours of duty.</p>
<p class="continued">Whether then-Chief Lanier's authority under D.C. Code &sect;1-612.01, is at issue in this matter; or, has any bearing on the issue of compensation for the 7-D Power Shift and CDU members.</p></blockquote>
<h4 align="center"><i>POSITION OF THE PARTIES</i></h4>
<p><i>The Union</i><ftnote num="6"><para>Copied, with edits, from FOP's post-hearing brief.</para></ftnote> &ldquo;&hellip; the scheduling rights of police officers are central to their employment relationship. Because of the unique responsibility and commitment to the community that D.C. Police Union members serve, scheduling is designed and negotiated to provide members with as much consistency and predictability as is possible in non-emergency situations. Here, &hellip; while planning for a visit from the Pope takes time, it is not an emergency (and no emergency was declared here) and it is not a seriously handicapping event as required in order to suspend the workweek rules under D.C. Code &sect;1-612.01. Moreover, &hellip; even if it were a &ldquo;seriously handicapping event.&rdquo; &hellip; the Metropolitan Police Department would still not be able to suspend the DC workweek rules because MPD has failed to set forth an exception determination as required in order to suspend the rules in D.C. Code &sect;1-612.01. Moreover, while &hellip; MPD sustained a portion of the grievance in this case, &hellip; MPD has failed to identify and pay all affected members at the rate of time-and-one-half for the hours worked outside of the members' originally scheduled tours of duty from April 17, 2008 through April 20, 2008.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Papal visit raised issues related to D.C. Code 1-612.01(b) because the Chief stated that she had the authority under D.C. Code &sect;1-612.01 to determine seriously handicapping conditions, but then stated that the members' schedules were changed to help the efficiency of the department. Prior to issuing the teletype changing the schedules for the Papal visit, MPD did not make an analysis to demonstrate that it would be &ldquo;seriously handicapped&rdquo; if these schedules could not be changed. Here, in response to the grievance and after the Pope had come and gone, MPD simply stated that &ldquo;&lsqb;t&rsqb;he members were scheduled to work the most appropriate tours of duty for the efficiency of the service of the Department.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because of the MPD's &ldquo;unlawful and improper implementation of the scheduling changes for the 2008 Papal visit,&rdquo; the D.C. Police Union requested the Arbitrator to enter an order sustaining the grievance, finding that MPD violated both the contract (Articles 4 and 24) and the DC Code (DC Code &sect;1-612.01) and compelling the MPD to conduct an audit to properly identify and pay all the affected members of this group grievance. The Union requested costs and attorney's fees be assessed against MPD.</p>
<h4 align="left"><i>The Agency:</i></h4>
<p>Article 4, Section 2 of the CBA provides, in part, that it is Management's right to &ldquo;determine the mission, budget, organization, number of employees, number, type and grade of employees assigned, the work project, tour of duty, methods and processes by which such work is performed &hellip;.&rdquo; In this case, Management exercised its right to determine the tours of duty that members must work to ensure the highest levels of security for the Pope and the public during the events affiliated with his visit.</p>
<p>The Department acknowledged that during the Papal visit, MPD members were required to work tours of duty that were different than their scheduled tours and with less than 14-day notice. The Department did not try to evade its responsibility for the scheduling issue that existed. Chief Lanier acknowledged the problem and agreed to pay the affected members time-and-one-half for all hours worked outside of their regular tours of duty.</p>
<p>The Union demanded the affected members be paid at the rate of time and one-half for all hours worked in the new schedule. MPD had never paid time and one-half for all hours worked in a member's new tour of duty. The Department's Payroll Manager testified that she was knowledgeable of MPD's past practice in paying member for hours worked outside their tours of duty when scheduling violations occur.<ftnote num="7"><para>The parties stipulated the Department's former Director of Payroll, Ms. Keely Williams, was prepared to testify regarding the fact that MPD members, for many years, were paid at the rate of time and one-half for all hours worked outside of their regular tour of duty.</para></ftnote></p>
<p>The Department acknowledged that an Article 24 violation occurred, but the violation was not &ldquo;willful&rdquo; nor an intentional effort to deprive members of working their regular tours of duty and days off. Rather, it was a part of the Department's vital security mission.</p>
<p>The Chief's delegated authority under the D.C. Code cannot be considered because it was not raised in the grievance, the demand for arbitration or in the intervening seven years since the event.<ftnote num="8"><para>In <quote>The specific remedy or adjustment sought,</quote> section of the Step 2 grievance, the FOP listed: A. That MPD compensate each affected member with overtime at the rate of time and a half pay for the entire amount of regular hours worked. B. That MPD desist from violating the D.C. Code and the Agreement.</para></ftnote> The remedy section of the Step 2 Group Grievance did not grieve or otherwise challenging the Chief of Police's authority under D.C. Code &sect;1-612.01, or, a ruling as to whether in the instant matter, that the Agency would be &ldquo;seriously handicapped &hellip;&rdquo; in carrying out its functions.</p>
<p>To allow consideration of the Chief's authority for the first time at arbitration would be a violation of Article 19 (Grievance Procedure), E (Arbitration), Section 5 (2) of the CBA, which provides &ldquo;&lsqb;t&rsqb;he parties to the grievance or appeal shall not be permitted to assert in such arbitration proceedings any ground or to rely on any evidence not previously disclosed to the other party.&rdquo; Since the Chief's delegated authority was not raised or even cited in the Step 1 grievance, the Step 2 grievance, the demand for arbitration, or the intervening seven-and-a-half years, the Union's attempt to raise it during the arbitration hearing constitutes a violation of the agreement. Consistent with the mandatory language in the labor agreement and past arbitration decisions, the union's untimely claim cannot be considered.</p>
<p>Yet, the Union is seeking a ruling on the Chief's delegated authority not for this case, but to use prospectively in other, unnamed cases. The Chief's delegated authority is not an issue raised in the FOP's Step 2 Group Grievance, and even if it were, there would be no applicable remedy. During the hearing, the Union revealed its motivation in asking the Arbitrator to make such a ruling. Specifically, when asked by the Arbitrator why the Chief's delegated authority should be at issue, Union Counsel declared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="continued">It's because in the future there will be situations where this will come up time and time again. And there needs to be a requirement that instead of just simply announcing, I believe it's seriously handicapping, and providing no explanation, no justification, as to why that is, that there be a requirement in order to abide by the D.C. Code that there be articulated reasons for that in fairness to the officers and their representatives.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Union's request for the Arbitrator to rule on an issue that is beyond the Arbitrator's scope of authority, since the Chief's delegated authority concerns prospective cases. Union Counsel established as much when he noted that &ldquo;in the future there will be situations where this will come up time and time again.&rdquo; However, any future cases where the Chief's delegated authority may or may not be at issue is beyond the scope of the matter to be decided here. The issues and the requested remedies are very clearly expressed in the FOP's Step 2 Grievance &ndash; alleged scheduling violations, and the correct method of paying members for these violations when they occur.</p>
<p>The Arbitrator should reject the FOP's request for a ruling on Chief Lanier's delegated authority since, it would: (a) be a ruling on prospective cases; (b) it is beyond the Arbitrator's scope of authority; and, (c) it is a clear violation of Article 19, E, Section 5(2) of the parties CBA.</p>
<h4 align="center"><i>DISCUSSION</i></h4>
<p>The Pope's visit to the area had to have been long in the planning. The Agency did not and could not with any justification declare the visit an &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; that would have allowed the Chief to suspend the 14 days' notice requirement of Article 24 Section 1.<ftnote num="9"><para>Section 2. <quote>&hellip; The Chief or his/her designed may suspend Section 1 on a Department wide basis or in an operational unit of a declared emergency, for crime, or for an unanticipated event.</quote></para></ftnote> The Chief conceded, Police officers' tours of duty were changed with fewer than the 14 days' notice required by the CBA. The Chief, at least by implication, conceded the MPD violated the plain language of CBA Article 24 by changing tours of duty with less than 14 days' notice.</p>
<p>End of story? Not according to the Union. In addition to charging CBA violations, FOP challenged the legality of the change in schedules for another reason. D.C. Code &sect;1-612.01 does not permit a change in tours of duty except when the Department determines it would be &ldquo;seriously handicapped&rdquo; in carrying out its function or costs would substantially increase. The FOP argues the Chief erroneously applied the &ldquo;serious handicapped&rdquo; exception to D.C. Code 1-612.01 restriction as her justification for changing tours of duty. She ruled the restriction on changing scheduled was lifted because she had been delegated and was exercising the Mayor's statutory right to make changes in hours of work to avert seriously handicapping the Department in carrying out its functions or substantially increasing its costs. The Agency claims the issue cannot be considered because it was not raised in the grievance or the demand for arbitration, and to allow consideration of this issue for the first time at arbitration, would violated the restriction in CBA Article 19 E Section 5 (2) that &ldquo;&lsqb;t&rsqb;he parties to the grievance or appeal shall not be permitted to assert in such arbitration proceedings any ground or to rely on any evidence not previously disclosed to the other party.&rdquo; The Department says its objection to the D.C. Code claim is reinforced by FOP's explanation that the issue will arise in future cases and a ruling on application of the D.C. Code provision is required out of fairness to its members.</p>
<p>An examination of the Grievance reveals a violation of the D.C. Code exception to work hours changes was charged. The Grievance was explicit that the D.C. Code section was violated by &ldquo;changing the working hours in each day in the basic workweek.&rdquo; The Chief's denial of the Group Grievance at Step 2 March 18, 2009, confirmed the Department considered D.C. Code section 1-612.01 was at issue. She ruled the D.C. Code section 1-612.01 restriction on working hour changes did not apply because the Mayor had delegated to her his authority to make a determination whether an organization would be &lsquo;seriously handicapped&rsquo; in carrying out its function or that costs would be substantially increased and she exercised that authority and concluded, without explanation or factual support, the schedule changes were triggered by a &ldquo;seriously handicapped&rdquo; condition.</p>
<p>The Union argues the D.C. Code exception to changes in the basic workweek is required in this arbitration because &ldquo;in the future there will be situations where this will come up time and time again, and there needs to be a requirement that instead of just simply announcing, I believe it's seriously handicapping,&rdquo; the Department must offer more than the conclusory unsupported explanation the Chief used here to invoke the D.C. Code exception to justify the schedule changes.</p>
<p>A sustainable application of the D.C. Code section must go beyond reciting the statutory words. Compliance with the workweek laws, would demand MPD to produce a defensible explanation that without scheduling changes the MPD's operations would be seriously handicapped to the point that it would not be able to carry out its essential functions as a police department. More would be required than the Chief's explanation here that the scheduling changes were made &ldquo;to meet the manpower requirements for this event.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To be clear, this Decision does not concern prospective cases. It is beyond the range of this Arbitrator's jurisdiction to rule on what the Department must demonstrate in future cases to justify a seriously handicap exception to changing its work rules.</p>
<h4 align="center"><i>CONCLUSION</i></h4>
<p>The Department violated CBA's 14 days' notice requirement.</p>
<p>The Department violated the D.C. Code restriction on tour hours changes by asserting but failing to validate a seriously handicapping event that would have vindicated the legality of the changes in schedules during the period of the Pope's visit. This is a ruling on Chief Lanier's exercise of delegated authority; not a ruling on prospective cases, nor beyond the Arbitrator's scope of authority.</p>
<p>Accordingly, based upon the record, MPD violated both Articles 24 and the DC Code (DC Code &sect;1-612.01) the grievance is sustained. MPD is Ordered to conduct an audit and compensate the affected members of the Force at the rate of time-and-one-half for the hours worked outside of the members' originally scheduled tours of duty from April 17, 2008 through April 20, 2008 in accordance with CBA Article 24.<ftnote num="10"><para>The Code section requires <quote>overtime</quote> be paid at time and one-half in accordance with the FLSA, but does not prescribe monetary remedies for illegal changes in schedules.</para></ftnote></p>
<p>The Union request for costs and attorney's fees is denied.<ftnote num="11"><para>FOP Counsel argued the agency's behavior was <quote>willful and not accidental,</quote> and the FLSA liquidated damages provision should apply. There was no claim for liquidated damages asserted by FOP in the Grievance, on the record, or in FOP's post-hearing brief and is rejected. The Union brief did ask for an order requiring MPD to pay costs and attorney's fees. This request is unsupported on the record and is denied.</para></ftnote></p>
<p>MPD shall be responsible for payment of the Arbitrator's fee. See Article 20 Section 5-7.</p>
