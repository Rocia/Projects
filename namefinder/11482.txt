<p>INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MACHINISTS AND AEROSPACE WORKERS DISTRICT LODGE NO. W24, LOCAL 1005, Union, vs. DAIMLER TRUCKS NORTH AMERICA, Employer.</p>
<p>Arbitration Case</p>
<p>FMCS No. 15708-56877-6</p>
<p>April 5, 2017.</p>
<p>Kenneth James Latsch, Arbitrator</p>
<p class="continued">The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers district Lodge No. W24, Local 1005 (Union) and Daimler Trucks North America (Employer) selected Kenneth J. Latsch from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service dispute resolution panel to decide a grievance concerning Joseph Martinez's (Grievant) employment status. A hearing was conducted on October 10 and December 7, 2016 in Portland, Oregon. During the course of the hearing, the parties presented witnesses and documentary evidence to support their respective positions before the Arbitrator. The parties submitted post-hearing briefs on February 28, 2017. The briefs were received in a timely manner, and with the receipt of the briefs, the hearing was closed.</p>
<h4 align="center">ISSUE</h4>
<p class="continued">The parties were unable to stipulate to the issues for determination in this grievance. The Union proposed that the issues could be stated as:</p>
<blockquote><p class="continued">Did the Company violate the collective bargaining agreement and the grievance settlement of February 19, 2015, by repeatedly not providing Joseph Martinez employment by seniority?</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The Employer proposed the following statement of the issue:</p>
<blockquote><p class="continued">Whether the Company violated any resolution of grievance number D150101, and, if so, what is the remedy?</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">I have reviewed the issues set forth by the parties, and I conclude that the issues for determination can be stated as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p class="continued">Did the Employer violate terms of the collective bargaining agreement or terms of the grievance resolution of February 19, 2015 in its efforts to provide employment to Joseph Martinez?</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">If so, what is the appropriate remedy?</p>

<h4 align="center">BACKGROUND</h4>
<h4 align="left"><i>The Employer's Operation</i></h4>
<p class="continued">Daimler Trucks North America (Employer) manufactures a variety of heavy duty, medium duty trucks as well as specialty commercial vehicles at its Portland, Oregon production facility.</p>
<p class="continued">The Employer has a collective bargaining relationship with International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District Lodge No. W24, Local 1005 (Union) on behalf of a bargaining unit of employees described in the parties' July 22, 2013 through October 28, 2016 collective bargaining agreement as follows:</p>
<h4 align="left"><i>ARTICLE 1. &ndash; TERRITORY AND WORK AFFECTED</i></h4>
<blockquote><p class="continued">This Agreement shall cover all production and maintenance employees employed in the Employer's plants at 5400 North Basin Street and 6936 North Fathom, Portland, Oregon and any relocation, extension or expansion of such plants within the present jurisdiction of District Lodge No. W24, IAM-AFL-CIO, excluding all Supervisors with the authority to hire or fire or effectively recommend same, office workers, engineering employees, draftsmen, guards, partsmen, material handlers, painters and janitors.</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The Employer has established detailed production standards for its Portland facility. Trucks are assembled on a production line that is almost always in motion throughout the plant. Trucks are moved along the production line at a slow but steady pace, and assembly work is done at designated areas. The work to be performed take place in several departments, or &ldquo;work areas&rdquo;. For example, the &ldquo;Cab in White&rdquo; area is where the truck cabs are constructed. The &ldquo;Midline/Engine Line&rdquo; is where engines are joined to transmissions and radiators. The &ldquo;Final Cab&rdquo; area is where upholstery and dashboards are installed. The Employer describes the truck building steps as &ldquo;processes&rdquo;. Processes are further divided into job &ldquo;elements&rdquo;, or individual steps needed to complete an entire process. Once all of the processes are completed, the truck is finished.</p>
<p class="continued">Each process has specific work assigned to it, so that it can be determined how much work is to be completed for that process to be completed. Generally speaking, each process equates to an employee who is responsible for its completion. The employee performs the same process for each truck coming through his or her station. Each process is designed to take the same amount of time for each truck being built. This amount of time is referred to as &ldquo;takt time&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="continued">Takt time is determined by taking the total number of minutes in a day that are available for truck building divided by the number of trucks the plant has to build each day. In its closing brief, the Employer provided a good example of how takt time would be determined:</p>
<blockquote><p class="continued">So, if the truck plant is producing 21 trucks per day, each employee performs the same process 21 times per day, restarting the process every 21.4 minutes (450 available minutes &divide; 21 trucks). DTNA designs each process so that the entire process takes approximately 94&percnt; of the overall takt time. So, there is some room for unexpected delays (6&percnt;) already built into the processes.</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Using the calculated takt time, the &ldquo;drag chain&rdquo; that moves the trucks through the assembly process is set to move at a specific number of feet per minute so that each truck moves through each process area every 21.4 minutes.</p>
<p class="continued">Some processes are not located on the production line. However, takt time still applies to the &ldquo;off line&rdquo; work. The off line production is intended to provide enough sub-assemblies to be available for the production line work, and must be done in a timely manner so that the production line will not be delayed.</p>
<p class="continued">Each process element depends on the successful completion of the immediately preceding processes. Accordingly, the Employer cannot allow a process station to be empty or understaffed while production is under way. In order to meet its staffing requirements, the Employer maintains an additional 15&percnt; of its total shift strength to compensate for absences at the plant. This extra workforce is determined by the Employer, and is used to cover for illnesses, absences from work and vacation leave.</p>
<h4 align="left"><i>The Employer's Personnel and Accommodation Policies</i></h4>
<p class="continued">The Employer has adopted a number of personnel policies and rules to define the employment relationship. The Employer is committed to the concept of equal opportunity employment and does not tolerate discrimination against employees or applicants with disabilities. The Employer's human resources manual provides, in pertinent part:</p>
<blockquote><p class="continued">In the recruitment, selection, training, utilization, upgrading or termination of any individual, or in any other personnel related activities, there will be no discrimination based on characteristics protected by law such as &hellip; disability &hellip;. 5 DTNA will afford reasonable accommodation to qualified applicants and employees with a known disability. Any employee who is disabled may voluntarily inform their supervisor or a member of the location's Human Resources Department of any physical or mental disability and may suggest methods of reasonable accommodation. This information is confidential and will be used only to evaluate reasonable accommodation alternatives to permit the employee to perform the essential functions of the job in a safe and efficient manner. &hellip;. Any employee who believes that he or she is having difficulty in continuing to meet the performance requirements of the job due to a physical or mental disability is encouraged to advise their supervisor or a member of the location's Human Resources Department regarding the nature of the disability, the work limitations covered by the disability and any suggested reasonable accommodation.</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">If the Employer is notified that an employee may have work restrictions due to a disability, Disability Coordinator Karla Steffenson provides the affected employee with a &ldquo;reasonable accommodation request form&rdquo;, and an Americans with Disability Act (ADA) certification form that must be completed by the employee's doctor. As part of the process, the Employer routinely prepares job analyses for the employee's doctor. A job analysis describe the specific duties associated with a particular position. The explanation provided by a job analysis assists the doctor in determining whether an employee's limitations would allow him or her to perform the essential functions of a particular position.</p>
<p class="continued">If an employee's restrictions are to be determined to be temporary, the Employer may provide &ldquo;light duty&rdquo; so the employee can return to his or her full work capacity in a timely manner. If the employee's disabilities are found to be permanent, and he or she cannot do her regular job, the Employer will work to identify a transfer into an open position for which the employee can perform the essential functions. The Employer relies on the opinion of the employee's doctor in deciding how to make necessary accommodations.</p>
<h4 align="left"><i>The Grievant's Employment</i></h4>
<p class="continued">Joseph Martinez (Grievant) started employment with Daimler Trucks of North America on September 6, 1994. During the course of his employment, Mr. Martinez held several production positions. In January, 2014, he worked in the &ldquo;Final Chassis&rdquo; work area in a &ldquo;wiring/routing&rdquo; job assignment under the immediate direction of Production Supervisor Cheryl Rouse. In his position, Mr. Martinez was responsible for installing a wiring harness to the truck engine and bolting brackets onto the engine for other equipment to be added later. Mr. Martinez had to use &ldquo;tie straps&rdquo; to bundle the wiring harnesses, and his job put a great deal of stress on his hands. Mr. Martinez's job was on the production line, and even before he encountered medical problems, he had difficulty maintaining the necessary pace.</p>
<p class="continued">In January, 2014, Mr. Martinez experienced difficulties with his hands, and on January 8, 2014, he was placed on a leave of absence. Mr. Martinez was diagnosed with arthritis in both hands, although it appears that his left hand was affected more. Mr. Martinez's doctor also diagnosed him with tenosynovitis and carpal tunnel syndrome in both hands. Mr. Martinez filed a workers' compensation claim, but the claim was denied. It was determined that the arthritic condition was congenital and not necessarily work-related. From January until September, 2014, Mr. Martinez was unable to return to work.</p>
<p class="continued">On September 17, 2014, Mr. Martinez's doctor cleared him to return to work, but indicated that Mr. Martinez could have problems keeping up the necessary pace of work because of weakness in his left hand strength. His doctor also stated that his condition was permanent.</p>
<p class="continued">The Employer reviewed the medical report and concluded that Mr. Martinez may not be able to return to the wiring job that he held immediately before his absence. Following established procedure, Ms. Steffenson sent Mr. Martinez a &ldquo;Reasonable Accommodation Request&rdquo; form along with an ADA medical certification form to be completed by Mr. Martinez's doctor. On September 26, 2014, the Employer also provided Mr. Martinez's doctor a copy of the job requirements for the wiring job that Mr. Martinez held. On October 13, 2014, Mr. Martinez's doctor responded, stating that Mr. Martinez could not perform &ldquo;all or some of the duties included in the job description&rdquo; for the wiring position. Mr. Martinez's doctor recommended the following accommodations for his return to work: 1. Work at a reduced pace; and 2. Limit left-hand grip strength requirements to 12 pounds.</p>
<p class="continued">On October 22, 2014, Ms. Steffenson contacted Mr. Martinez's doctor to discuss the proposed limitations on the pace of his work. Dr. Martinez's doctor explained that Mr. Martinez could work at 50&percnt; speed for four weeks, and then at 60&percnt; speed thereafter.</p>
<p class="continued">Mr. Martinez filled out the request for accommodation, stating that he was seeking a &ldquo;job reassignment&rdquo;, although he did not suggest what other position he might be able to perform. Mr. Martinez proposed a reduction in the amount of work he would have to perform in the wiring position he previously held. The Employer determined that it could not satisfy Mr. Martinez's request because slowing his work would have a ripple effect throughout the entire production line, slowing the number of trucks produced to an unacceptable level. In addition, the wiring job required Mr. Martinez to use both hands, and it was impossible to reconfigure the work to meet his particular needs.</p>
<p class="continued">By the end of 2014, the Employer had not found any position that could accommodate Mr. Martinez. In November, 2014, the Employer's Human Resources Office conducted a regular monitoring process to find out if any vacancies on the production line may work for Mr. Martinez. Ms. Steffenson explained this process to Mr. Martinez in a telephone call on November 3, 2014, and he agreed to remain on leave while the review went forward.</p>
<p class="continued">On November 4, 2014, Gable Hofman, the Employer's Labor Relations Specialist, met with Mr. Martinez and Union Shop Steward Dwain Panian to discuss the situation. During that meeting, Mr. Panian suggested that Mr. Martinez could work in either the &ldquo;offline&rdquo; or the &ldquo;cab in white&rdquo; work areas, although the Union did not suggest specific jobs that he could perform. On November 14, 2014, Mr. Panian, Mr. Hofman and Ms. Steffenson called Mr. Martinez to inform him that there were no vacant positions available for him at that time.</p>
<p class="continued">Mr. Hofman spoke with Mr. Martinez again on December 4, 2014. During this conversation, Mr. Martinez showed interest in the &ldquo;cabin in white&rdquo; assembly process, and that he would like to work there. Mr. Hofman followed up on the conversation with Mr. Martinez by emailing Ms. Steffenson. Mr. Hofman informed her of Mr. Martinez's interest in &ldquo;cab in white&rdquo; work, and that he had contacted union officials to assure them that the Employer would strive to find a position that he could fill. Mr. Hofman asked Ms. Steffenson if she could check with &ldquo;cab in white&rdquo; supervisors to determine if there was anything available for Mr. Martinez.</p>
<p class="continued">Also on December 4, 2014, Ms. Steffenson followed up with an email to Roger Malcolmson, &ldquo;cab in white&rdquo; Production Supervisor, and other management officials asking them to see if there was an open job that may work for Mr. Martinez. Mr. Malcomson answered the same day, stating that there were several job elements that could accommodate Mr. Martinez, but there was no single position that could accommodate him in the &ldquo;cab in white&rdquo; area.</p>
<p class="continued">Members of the Employer's management team contacted Mr. Martinez regularly to inform him of their efforts to find him an acceptable position. Mr. Martinez became frustrated with the process because he wanted to return to work. On December 11, 2014, Mr. Martinez called Mr. Hofman to express his concern and to say that he believed that the Employer was not really trying to find a position for him.</p>
<p class="continued">On December 16, 2014, Mr. Martinez wrote to Human Resources Manager Wright to say he was surprised that the Employer could not find a position for him. Mr. Martinez also suggested that his need to work at a reduced pace &ldquo;can be met by working in a department without production quotas&rdquo;. At hearing, Ms. Wright testified that all departments in the Employer's facility must meet established production standards.</p>
<p class="continued">On December 31, 2014, the Employer's production plan was shut down for the holiday season. On that date, Mr. Martinez sent a fax to the Employer's administrative office, stating that &ldquo;Jessica &lsqb;Gore&rsqb; in the nurse's station&rdquo; instructed him to return to work on January 2, 2015.</p>
<p class="continued">On January 2, 2015, Mr. Martinez came to the facility. Mr. Martinez told security guards that Mr. Hofman had invited him. He was allowed to enter the facility, where he met with Ms. Steffenson, Mr. Hofman, Human Resource Representative Ferrol Walton, and Production Supervisor Todd Crittenden. It was determined that there was no position available for him, so Mr. Martinez was instructed to go home and to wait for a call from the Employer concerning his availability for work. Later that day, Ms. Gore notified Ms. Walton that she never had any contact with Mr. Martinez about coming in to the plant.</p>
<p class="continued">On January 7, 2015, Mr. Martinez participated in a telephone call with Mr. Hofman. During the telephone call, he insisted that Mr. Hofman or Ms. Gore were lying about the situation and that he had been instructed to report to the facility. The Employer continued to look for positions that would meet Mr. Martinez's limitations. The Employer concentrated on positions that were not on the production line, giving Mr. Martinez more time to perform assigned tasks.</p>
<p class="continued">Since positons off the production line are not as time sensitive as those on the line, they are very desirable to bargaining unit members. These positions are typically filled by employees with high seniority, and there is little turnover in the departments where these positions are located. Accordingly, there it was very difficult to find a position for Mr. Martinez.</p>
<p class="continued">On January 8, 2015, Mr. Martinez filed a grievance alleging that he was &ldquo;&lsqb;d&rsqb;enied employment by seniority when released to work in violation of &lsqb;the&rsqb; CBA including but not limited to Articl 2, 4 &lsqb;and&rsqb; 5&rdquo;. On January 20, 2015 Mr. Panian and Union Business Representative Joe Kear met with Ms. Wright in the grievance's first step procedure. During this meeting, Ms. Wright stated that the Employer was concerned about finding a position for Mr. Martinez where he would not injure himself, and that it was difficult to find a position he could fill because of the Employer's ongoing production requirements. The record does not reveal any discussions about Mr. Martinez's seniority during this meeting.</p>
<p class="continued">On January 23, 2015, Mr. Hofman spoke with Nohl Nunes, a supervisor in the &ldquo;Finish Cab&rdquo; work area. Mr. Nunes stated that one of his employees, James Peters&rdquo; submitted a transfer request to move to the &ldquo;Cab in White&rdquo; work area. Given the nature of the work he performed, it did not appear that Mr. Peters' position would be a good fit for Mr. Martinez. However, another employee, Elnora Riley, who worked in the Electric Shop had a transfer request to the &ldquo;Finish Cab&rdquo; area and was interested in the work Mr. Peters had performed. Mr. Nunes and Mr. Hofman agreed that Mr. Martinez may be able to perform the Electric Shop work that Ms. Riley had been performing. A job analysis for the Electric Shop position was sent to Mr. Martinez's doctor on January 28, 2015. The Employer and the Union agreed that the Electric Shop position would not have to go up for seniority bid in this circumstance.</p>
<p class="continued">On February 18, 2015, Dr. Martinez's doctor approved of the Electric Shop position, and the Employer returned Mr. Martinez to work on February 19, 2015. On the same date, the Union withdrew the grievance that had been filed on January 8, 2015. The withdrawal was noted on the grievance form in the following terms: &ldquo;Employee returned to work 2/19/15. Union withdraws grievance&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="continued">On February 23, 2015, Mr. Peters exercised his right to reverse his transfer to the &ldquo;Cab in the White&rdquo; work area and to return to his former assignment in the &ldquo;Finish Cab&rdquo; area. Mr. Peters' decision created several other personnel moves that affected Mr. Martinez. Mr. Peters' return to the &ldquo;Finish Cab&rdquo; area effectively nullified Ms. Riley's transfer, and she returned to her original assignment in the Electric Shop. With her return, there was no position available that met Mr. Martinez's work restrictions.</p>
<p class="continued">On February 25, Mr. Hofman and Ms. Steffenson discussed possible openings for Mr. Martinez. Mr. Hofman was aware of a position in the &ldquo;Final Chassis&rdquo; area, but that position was designated as a &ldquo;MAV job&rdquo;. MAV stood for Medical, Absent, Vacation, and MAV employees do not have a permanent process in the assembly process. Rather, MAV employees work in particular work areas and are expected to cover several positions, depending on specific absences. In effect, MAV employees are utility workers who must be proficient in all work processes in a particular work area. In this case, it would mean that Mr. Martinez would have to be able to perform all of the processes in the Final Chassis area.</p>
<p class="continued">It was determined that the MAV position could not work, because one of the processes that would be covered was the wiring position that Mr. Martinez had to leave in the first place. On February 25, Mr. Hofman met with Mr. Martinez and Mr. Panian, informing them that there was no longer an available position for Mr. Martinez since Ms. Riley returned to the Electric Shop. During the course of the meeting, the Union expressed an interest in allowing Mr. Martinez to &ldquo;bump&rdquo; a less senior employee in Cab in White to find an acceptable position, waiving specific seniority language in the collective bargaining agreement. Mr. Hofman stated that the Employer may be receptive to that concept and would keep that in mind. Mr. Martinez left the facility, returning to &ldquo;leave of absence&rdquo; status. Mr. Hofman told Mr. Martinez that Ms. Steffenson would call him each week he was off work to let him know if anything had changed in position availability.</p>
<p class="continued">Also on February 25, 2015, Mr. Martinez filed a second grievance concerning his employment situation. The second grievance alleged that there had been a &ldquo;&lsqb;v&rsqb;iolation of grievance resolution, as agreed for grievance #D150101&rdquo;. The Union argued that there were several other positions available for Ms. Riley in the Finish Cab area. The Union identified at least three positions that were open in the department, and maintained that Ms. Riley could fill any of them.</p>
<p class="continued">On March 3, 2015, a Labor/Management Productivity Meeting was held. Plant Manager Paul Erdy explained that the Employer was in process of reducing its work force by 42 positions, without reducing the amount of work to be performed. Reductions were targeted to the &ldquo;Pre-Paint Chassis&rdquo;, &ldquo;Final Chassis&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Finish Cab&rdquo; areas.</p>
<p class="continued">On March 6, 2015, the Employer responded to the Union's grievance, arguing that the position that Mr. Martinez could hold was no longer available, and that management staff would &ldquo;actively look for another compatible position. The Employer conducted a series of job analysis reports for potential jobs, but none were found to be acceptable.</p>
<p class="continued">At a grievance meeting held on April 14, 2015, Mr. Martinez asked Mr. Hofman to explain again why he was &ldquo;bumped&rdquo; from the Electric Shop position. Mr. Hofman explained the chain of events that took place and asked Mr. Martinez if he could identify any position that he could fill. It appears that Mr. Martinez did not identify any jobs during the course of the meeting, other than the position in the Electric Shop that he had just left.</p>
<p class="continued">The Union suggested that the Employer could bring Mr. Martinez back in place of an upcoming &ldquo;summer hire&rdquo; that was anticipated for the assembly line. The Employer had a practice of hiring several employees during summer months to supplement the workforce during the traditional vacation period. A summer hire is considered to be a MAV employee, and as explained above, must be able to perform a number of job processes throughout the assembly line. Given Mr. Martinez's limitations, it did not appear that a summer hire position would be appropriate. In addition, summer work was considered to be temporary, so it would not meet Mr. Martinez's desire to permanently return to work.</p>
<p class="continued">Mr. Panian observed that there were at least three other positions in the Finish Cab area that Ms. Riley could have transferred into, thus allowing Mr. Martinez to stay in the Electric Shop. However, Mr. Panian was reminded that Ms. Riley also had limitations, and that it was unclear whether any of the three positions met her physical requirements. In addition, it was not clear that Ms. Riley wanted any of those positions in the first place.</p>
<p class="continued">In March 2015, Mr. Martinez retained a private attorney and brought a claim against the Employer with the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries (BOLI). On his initial filing, Mr. Martinez stated that the Employer had a vacant position available for him. In response to another question on the form, Mr. Martinez stated that the position was &ldquo;quality control, sorting parts, cleaning, cabin &lsqb;sic&rsqb; white, electrical, rough cab, offline, hoods, many others&rdquo;. Mr. Martinez later admitted that his answer was not accurate. The answers related to Mr. Martinez's training and capabilities but not his physical ability to perform the jobs he listed.</p>
<p class="continued">On April 17, 2015, Mr. Martinez filed a complaint with BOLI, alleging that the Employer failed to offer reasonable accommodation. Nicole Babnick, a Senior Civil Rights Investigator for BOLI interviewed Mr. Martinez on June 11, 2015. Mr. Martinez's private attorney was also present. During the course of that meeting, it was established that Mr. Martinez's earlier worker compensation claim had been denied. In addition, Mr. Martinez stated that he was not aware of any position that he could perform because of his physical limitations. Mr. Martinez also acknowledged that he could not &ldquo;work to pace&rdquo; on the assembly line.</p>
<p class="continued">On June 29, 2015, BOLI dismissed Mr. Martinez's complaint. BOLI found that Mr. Martinez had not provided &ldquo;substantial evidence&rdquo; of unlawful practices. BOLI also concluded that Mr. Martinez's proposed solution to his employment problem would have violated seniority terms in the collective bargaining agreement, and that Mr. Martinez's limited work ability would have caused an unacceptable slowdown in the Employer's production work.</p>
<p>In an effort to find Mr. Martinez, the Employer began supplying job analyses for positions that were not yet open to his doctor for review. The Employer reasoned that if there was an acceptable position, it would do everything possible to get Mr. Martinez back to work when the position opened. Between March and May 2015, Mr. Martinez's doctor approved eight possible positions for him if the positions came open. The Employer's Human Resources team also telephoned him weekly to let him know about their efforts to get him back to work.</p>
<p class="continued">Mr. Hofman also looked at positions that Mr. Martinez could fill that were currently held by bargaining unit employees with less seniority. However, this effort stopped on June 11, 2015, when Mr. Kear withdrew the Union's offer to bump a junior employee. Mr. Kear stated that the Union believed that the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) required application of the collective bargaining agreement's seniority provisions and would not allow a grievance resolution that disrupted the seniority principle. In the same letter, Mr. Kear identified two positions in the Cab in White area that would be coming vacant and that could meet Mr. Martinez's needs. However, given the position taken by the Union about seniority, the Employer believed that both of the positions would have to go up for regular seniority bidding.</p>
<p class="continued">On June 25, 2015, the Union sent a letter to Mr. Erdy, requesting that the grievance be moved to arbitration. The Union noted that an opening in the Finish Cab area occurred with an employee's retirement on June 30, 2015. On July 10, 2015, the Union filed a grievance on behalf of Ms. Riley, who was still seeking a transfer to the Finish Cab area. The Union found several positions that she could fill, and at least one position had been filled on a temporary basis for over 90 days. The collective bargaining agreement required that positions filled on a temporary basis for more than 90 days must be submitted through the seniority process, and that Ms. Riley had seniority to claim the position at issue. On August 13, 2015, the Employer responded, stating that the disputed position would be filled through the contract's transfer provisions.</p>
<p class="continued">On August 20, 2015, the Union met with Human Resources Manager Rachelle Wright to discuss Mr. Martinez's grievance. The Union reasoned that Ms. Riley would now be allowed to transfer to the Finish Cab area, so Mr. Martinez should be allowed to report back to the Electric Shop.</p>
<p class="continued">On September 3, 2015, the Employer again brought Mr. Martinez back to work in the Electric Shop. Todd Crittenden, Finish Cab and Electric Shop Manager testified that Mr. Martinez told him that he could not do the work involved in the assignment, and Mr. Crittenden contacted Human Resources to determine what could be done. Mr. Panian was part of the meeting where Mr. Crittenden and Mr. Martinez discussed the matter. Mr. Panian testified that the Employer decided to send Mr. Martinez home because it needed &ldquo;clarification to the restrictions&rdquo; on Mr. Martinez's work.</p>
<p class="continued">On September 14, 2015, Mr. Martinez's doctor lifted the original restrictions on his employment, and on September 15, 2015, Mr. Martinez returned to his original wiring position. The underlying dispute about accommodating his medical limitation was still unresolved, resulting in the instant grievance arbitration proceeding.</p>
<h4 align="center">POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES</h4>
<h4 align="left"><i>The Union</i></h4>
<p class="continued">The Union argues that the Employer did not reasonably accommodate Joseph Martinez or allow him to remain employed from September 2014 to September 2015. The Union maintains that the Employer was reducing its workforce through attrition and reversed a transfer that would have allowed Mr. Martinez to stay in the Electric Shop after February 25, 2015. The Union contends that the Employer's actions amounted to Mr. Martinez's layoff from employment as part of the larger effort to reduce the size of the workforce. The Union argues that the Employer could have taken reasonable steps to make sure that Mr. Martinez could stay in the Electric Shop but did not pursue any of the available transfers and/or reassignments that could have prevented the instant situation.</p>
<p class="continued">The Union notes that Mr. Martinez was kept away from the workplace even when less senior employees were recalled and new employees with no bargaining unit seniority began employment. The Union maintains that Mr. Martinez was capable of a position in the Cab in White area that opened on June 19, 2015, but the Employer refused to place him in that position. The Union asserts that settlement of the original grievance was frustrated by the Employer's course of action concerning Mr. Martinez's employment, so, as a remedy, the Union is asking for back pay to the date of the original date of his release to work on September 17, 2014 until his return to work in September 2015.</p>
<p class="continued"><i>The Employer</i></p>
<p class="continued">The Employer argues that there was no violation of the collective bargaining agreement and this grievance should be denied. The Employer maintains that there was never any &ldquo;resolution&rdquo; to the first grievance because the Union withdrew the grievance as soon as Mr. Martinez returned to work in 2015. The Employer notes that the grievance does not allege any violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and that it was under no obligation to keep Mr. Martinez in the Electric Shop because such an action would have violated the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="continued">The Employer contends that this arbitration should not consider any claims about available positions after February 25, 2015, and even if these positions are addressed, the Employer asserts that it never failed to reasonably accommodate Mr. Martinez. The Employer maintains that it was not under any obligation to create a position for Mr. Martinez, nor could he be placed on &ldquo;light duty&rdquo; in light of existing production standards. In like manner, the Employer argues that it could not assign Mr. Martinez to a MAV position because of the variety of work that would be expected from him. The Employer concludes by contending that it could not allow Mr. Martinez to bid into new work areas, and that there was no obligation to place Mr. Martinez in a position that violated his physical limitations. The Employer contends that the grievance must be dismissed.</p>
<h4 align="center">ANALYSIS</h4>
<h4 align="left"><i>Is the Grievance Arbitrable?</i></h4>
<p class="continued">This grievance is disputed at several levels. The Employer argues that the matter is not arbitrable because the dispute does not arise from the &ldquo;settlement&rdquo; of a prior grievance. The Employer asserts that the Union withdrew the earlier grievance, and any reference to that dispute should not be considered here. Since the Union's argument rests on the existence of a &ldquo;settlement&rdquo;, the lack of a settled grievance removes the Arbitrator's jurisdiction to hear the instant dispute.</p>
<p class="continued">The Union argues that the first grievance was withdrawn based on specific actions taken by and that the underlying dispute was settled by the Employer's decision to bring Mr. Martinez back to work. The Union maintains that the dispute remained and that it would be inherently unfair to stop Mr. Martinez's grievance on a technicality.</p>
<p class="continued">In its closing brief, the Employer properly notes that arbitrators do not decide the merits of a dispute where the underlying grievance has been withdrawn by an authorized Union representative. <i>Glass Container Manufacturers</i>, 49 LA 974 (Dworkin, 1967). In <i>Associated Grocers of Colorado, Inc.</i> 74 141 (Finston, 1980), the principle was stated in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote><p class="continued">&hellip; &lsqb;T&rsqb;he Union has waived its right to arbitrate the &lsqb;&hellip;&rsqb; grievance by informing the Company on two separate occasions that this matter was being withdrawn. The Union may not reactivate the dispute two-and-one-half months later.</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">When Mr. Martinez returned to work on February 19, 2015, it appeared that the matter was resolved, and in the spirit of the moment, the Union withdrew its grievance on his behalf. When Mr. Martinez lost his assigned position because of a chain of seniority-based decisions that effectively moved the incumbent employee back to the position, the Union argues that the Employer violated the terms of a &ldquo;settlement&rdquo; of the prior grievance.</p>
<p class="continued">In February, 2015, the Union withdrew the earlier grievance. There was never any settlement document signed, nor did the Employer make any specific commitments to resolve the dispute other than to place Mr. Martinez in the Electric Shop position. Mr. Martinez started in a position that he could hold, and it appeared that the issue was closed. However, a series of events completely outside the Employer's control took place that set up a chain of transfers affecting Mr. Martinez's continued employment. This was undoubtedly a difficult and frustrating development. Mr. Martinez wanted to return to work and the Union was committed to his cause. The Employer could not &ldquo;force&rdquo; Mr. Martinez into its workforce, given existing seniority limitations and production requirements.</p>
<p class="continued">In effect, the Union is attempting to use its earlier grievance to create leverage for the personnel issues surrounding Mr. Martinez's return to work. By claiming that the Employer violated an agreement to put Mr. Martinez back to work, the Union puts the Employer on the defensive for any and all personnel decisions that took place after Mr. Martinez returned to work in February, 2015. Such a conclusion cannot be supported by the record made in this matter.</p>
<p class="continued">The Union chose to withdraw the earlier grievance. The Employer could not be expected to react to that grievance after it was withdrawn. I must conclude that the Employer did not violate any &ldquo;settlement&rdquo; of a grievance, because such a settlement did not exist. Without that crucial element, the Union's case must be dismissed.</p>
<p class="continued">It should be noted that the Employer took reasonable steps to accommodate Mr. Martinez's condition, regardless of whether the initial grievance was settled or not. The Employer kept Mr. Martinez notified of any positions that may come open, and while Mr. Martinez and the Union did not agree with some of the representations made by the Employer, I must conclude that the record shows a pattern of constructive and thoughtful responses concerning possible job openings.</p>
<p class="continued">During the course of the hearing and in its closing brief, the Union argues that the Employer's participation in discussions to accommodate Mr. Martinez after his return to work in February 2015 showed that it was trying to address issues raised in the original grievance. I must conclude that the Employer was attempting to find an appropriate position for Mr. Martinez based on the events that were actually transpiring at the time. Given the fluid nature of employment opportunities, a number of different positions had to be analyzed in light of Mr. Martinez's limited ability to perform any work. The Employer showed good faith in trying to find a position for Mr. Martinez and did not violate terms of the collective bargaining agreement in its efforts.</p>
<p class="continued">It has long been held that the Union must bear the burden of proof if it claims that the Employer has violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). In its closing brief, the Employer cited an arbitration award that is very instructive on this matter. In <i>CH2M-WG Idaho, LLC</i>, 134 LA 876 (DiFalco, 2014), a grievant alleged that an employer unjustly terminated her employment on the grounds that she could not perform the essential functions of any position. The grievant argued that the employer therefore treated her differently from other employees who were working under restrictions. Arbitrator DiFalco reasoned:</p>
<blockquote><p class="continued">The Employer is not terminating the employee for violating rules or engaging in conduct that would traditionally constitute grounds for discipline. This is a circumstance in which the Grievant is not being accused of any wrongdoing. Indeed, it is the Employer who is the defendant in this case, as the Union and the Grievant are asserting that the Employer is engaged in disparate treatment by failing to accommodate this Grievant's specific handicap through appropriate accommodation.</p>
<p class="continued">Initially, with regard to any ADA claims, the Arbitrator must find that the Employer's position is correct and that such claim has not been proven by an ADA handicap discrimination claim, which is the Grievant and her Union's obligation in this forum, as it would be in any EEO or court adjudication.</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The Union must prove that Mr. Martinez was covered by the ADA, that he gave the Employer notice of his disability and the need for an accommodation, and that after receiving that notice, the Employer failed to reasonably accommodate his disability. <i>Humphrey v. Memorial Hospital Association</i>, 239 F.3d 1128 (9<sup>th</sup> Cir. 2001). In addition, the Union must identify one or more reasonable accommodations. <i>Bates v.United Parcel Service</i> 511 F. 3d 974 (9<sup>th</sup> Cir. 2007). An employer is not expected to create a position <i>Wellington v. Lyon County School District</i>, 187 F.3d 1150 (9<sup>th</sup> Cir. 1999), nor is an employer expected to &ldquo;bump&rdquo; another employee to give the disabled employee a position to fill. <i>Gile v. United Airlines, Inc.</i> 95 F.3d 492 (7<sup>th</sup> Cir. 1996).</p>
<p class="continued">In like manner, an employer is not required to violate the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, <i>U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Barnett</i>, 535 U.S. 391 (2002), nor is an employer expected to eliminate essential functions of a particular job. Finally, an employer is not expected to lower production standards. <i>Milton v. Scrivner, Inc.</i> 53 F.3d 1118 (10<sup>th</sup> Cir. 1995).</p>
<p class="continued">In this case, the Employer took a number of steps to bring Mr. Martinez back to a position that he could fill. The Employer worked in good faith, and while the Union and Mr. Martinez may not have agreed with all of the choices being discussed, it is clear that the Employer met its obligations under the collective bargaining agreement to accommodate Mr. Martinez and bring him back to work. The grievance must be denied.</p>
<h4 align="center">AWARD</h4>
<p class="continued">Based on the foregoing and the record as a whole, the grievance filed by International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers district Lodge No. W24, Local 1005 on behalf of Joseph Martinez (FMCS No. 15708-56877-6), is hereby <i>dismissed</i>.</p>
