<p>ARBITRATION IN THE MATTER BETWEEN: MIAMI FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE LODGE &num;20 ON BEHALF OF GRIEVANT ADRIAN RODRIGUEZ, Grievant, Vs. CITY OF MIAMI, Employer.</p>
<p>Arbitration Case</p>
<p>Grievance No: 16-05</p>
<p>May 31, 2017.</p>
<p>Donald J. Spero, Arbitrator</p>
<h4 align="center"><i><b>OPINION AND ORDER OF ARBITRATOR</b></i></h4>
<p>Adrian Rodriguez (the &ldquo;Grievant&rdquo;) grieves his discharge from his position of a police officer in the Police Department of the City of Miami (the &ldquo;City&rdquo;). An evidentiary hearing was held on February 21, 2017 at the Miami City of Riverside Building, 444 Southwest Second Avenue in Miami Florida. Counsel for Miami Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 320, (the &ldquo;Union&rdquo;), Eugene Gibbons, Esquire, represented Mr. Rodriguez. Stephanie Panoff, Esquire and Kevin R. Jones, Esquire represented the City. A stenographic record and video recordings were made of the proceeding, The Arbitrator and the parties were provided with copies of the transcript.</p>
<p>Pursuant to leave granted by the Arbitrator at the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing, the City filed a motion to reconvene the hearing to allow the City to proceed with a line of inquiry propounded to Mr. Rodriguez by the City to which the Arbitrator sustained objections. A central basis for the objections was that Mr. Rodriguez' testimony was protected by the Fifth Amendment In an Interim Opinion and Order of Arbitrator dated April 24, 2017 the Arbitrator denied the motion of the City to reconvene the evidentiary hearing and reconsider his decision to exclude the Fifth Amendment evidence.</p>
<p>The current matter before the Arbitrator is whether the grievant was protected by the Fifth Amendment and by <i>&ldquo;Garrity&rdquo;</i><ftnote num="1"><para>In <italic>Garrity v. State of New Jersey</italic>, 385 U.S. 493 (1967) the Court held that statements given by police officers after they were told they would be fired if they did not provide the statements were coerced and could not be used in evidence in criminal cases brought against them. In <italic>Gardner v, Broderick</italic>, 392 U.S. 273, 276 the Court stated <quote>In <italic>&lsqb;Garrity&rsqb;</italic>, we held that when a policeman had been compelled to testify by the threat that otherwise he would be removed from office, the testimony that he gave could not be used in a subsequent prosecution.</quote></para>
<para>See also <italic>Lefkowitz v. Cunningham</italic>, 431 U.S. 801, 805 (1977) where the Court held <quote>Our cases have established that a State may not impose penalties because a witness elects to exercise his Fifth Amendment right not to give incriminating testimony against himself.</quote></para></ftnote> rights from answering questions propounded to him during a police department inquiry on February 11, 2013. The inquiry concerned a robbery that took place in his presence about one year before the City hired him as a police officer. Also before the Arbitrator is the question of whether Mr. Rodriguez violated the conditions of the Relief of Duty status (&ldquo;ROD&rdquo;) on which he was placed on February 13, 2013.</p>
<h4 align="left"><i><b>Factual backgraund</b></i><ftnote num="2"><para>References herein to pages of the transcript of the evidentiary hearing are designated <quote>Tr. &hellip;.</quote> Joint exhibits are designated <quote>Int. ex. &hellip;,</quote> Exhibits presented by the City are designated <quote>City ex&hellip;..</quote></para></ftnote></h4>
<p>For the convenience of the parties the Arbitrator repeats herein parts of the factual background set forth in the Interim Opinion.</p>
<p>The City advances two reasons for dismissing Mr. Rodriguez from his police officer position. The bases for the City's decision are set forth in the memorandum he received dated April 27, 2016. (Int, Ex. 4, Tr. 201). (See also the testimony of the decision maker, Police Chief Rodolpho Lianes at Tr. 280.). The only fact witness presented by the City was Detective Louis Valdez,, who is assigned to the Internal Affairs Anti Corruption unit. In addition the City presented documentary evidence, videos and photographs.</p>
<p>The first reason for Mr. Rodriguez' dismissal occurred on February 11, 2013 when Mr. Rodriguez was called in to answer questions of homicide detective Ricardo Martinez relating to a robbery and murder that took place at a PCS Metro store on October 27, 2007. (Int. Ex. 4, Tr. 68, 69). The crime was committed approximately one year before Mr. Rodriguez was hired as a City police officer. The store manager, Mr. Yosbel Millaro-vega, died after having been shot during the commission of the crime. Mr. Rodriguez was an employee of the store at the time of the murder/robbery. He was working at the store when the crime was committed. On the day of the crime the police who were investigating the incident interviewed Mr. Rodriguez. (Tr. 109).</p>
<p>The second reason advanced by the City as the basis for Mr. Rodriguez' dismissal was his failure on three occasions to comply with the terms under which he was placed on Relieved of Duty (&ldquo;ROD&rdquo;) status. He was placed on that status on February 13, 2013, two days after he refused to answer questions of the detectives who were investigating the crime.</p>
<p>The circumstances that led to Mr. Rodriguez' discipline came about on December 17, 2012 when the City received a tip implicating Mr. Rodriguez in the robbery of the PCS Metro store. (Tr. 50, 51). After the City received the tip Mr. Rodriguez was called in on February 11, 2013, for questioning by Detective Ricardo Martinez. After Mr. Rodriguez was told that his father was a person of interest in the PCS Metro store robbery/murder case he left the room. (Tr. 69, 110). As stated in the reprimand Mr. Rodriguez received dated April 27, 2016 (Int. Ex. 4, p. 6) &ldquo;The interview ended abruptly as Officer Rodriguez refused to talk about the case because it involved his father.&rdquo; The homicide detectives did not tell Mr. Rodriguez that he could not leave the room. They did not order him to stay or to answer questions. (Tr. 126-27). They did not inform him he was subject to discipline if he refused to answer questions.</p>
<p>The City argues that Mr. Rodriguez did not assert his Fifth Amendment rights. However at the evidentiary hearing the City stipulated that he did so. (Tr. 214, lines 3: Mr. Jones: &ldquo;I stipulate. He asserted his Fifth Amendment right at the time they brought him in to re-interview him.&rdquo;). The testimony of detective Louis Valdes, who witnessed the interview by a monitor in another room, indicates that detective Valdes was aware Mr. Rodriguez was asserting his Fifth Amendment rights. (Tr. 124-25, 170-71). Mr. Rodriguez' lawyer in the criminal case, Alberto Milian, informed detective Arostequi, who became the lead homicide investigator on the PCS Metro case, that Mr. Rodriguez would not provide a voluntary statement unless he was given <i>Garrity</i> rights. (Tr. 164-65). This took place after detective Arostequi had left a voicemail for Mr. Rodriquez stating that he wanted to resume questioning him. (Tr. 163). In essence Mr. Rodriguez' demand was that any statement he gave to the homicide detectives would not be used in a criminal charge against him. Two days after his February 11, 2013 interview Mr. Rodriguez was placed on ROD status where he remained receiving full pay for two and one-half years until his dismissal on June 10, 2016. (Tr. 71).</p>
<p>While on ROD status Mr. Rodriguez was assigned to the Police Department's Internal Affairs division (the &ldquo;IA&rdquo;) for administrative purposes. Mr. Rodriguez was duly advised of his obligations while on ROD status in a memorandum from then Police Chief Manuel Orosa dated February 13, 2013. (Int. Ex. 5). He was informed in the memorandum that he was required to remain at home during working hours, Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. He was required to report by telephone to Internal Affairs twice a day, at 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. If he needed to leave his residence for personal reasons he was required to <i>first</i> obtain approval from Internal Affairs. Mr. Rodriguez was aware of his obligations while on ROD status. (Tr. 196).</p>
<h6 align="left"><i><b>The position of the city parties</b></i></h6>
<h6 align="left"><i><b>The position of the city</b></i></h6>
<p>The city asserts that Mr. Rodriguez' failure to answer questions of the homicide investigators violated numerous rules of conduct including cooperating with police investigations and the conduct of a police officer, (Int. Ex, 5, Tr. 96-102). At the heart of the City's argument is the oath signed by Mr. Rodriguez in order to become a police officer. The oath states in the following words:</p>
<blockquote><p class="continued">I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I am entitled to hold the office to which I have been appointed and that I will support, protect and defend the Constitution and Government of the United States and the State of Florida against all enemies, domestic or foreign, and that l will bear true faith, loyalty an allegiance to the same and that I will faithfully, without fear or favor, perform all duties of the office of police officer of the City of Miami on which I am about to enter, so help me God. (Int. Ex 7, Tr. 48).</p></blockquote>
<p>In its Post-Arbitration Brief the City has again raised the issue of the testimony that was excluded during the evidentiary hearing. That issue was decided in the Arbitrator's April 24th ruling. That ruling is <i>functus officio</i> and will not be revisited herein.</p>
<p>The City also contends<sub>,</sub> that Mr. Rodriguez' dismissal was justified because he violated the terms of his ROD status by leaving his home without first obtaining the required permission of his supervisor. It further argues that Mr. Jones stipulation that Mr. Rodriguez asserted his Fifth Amendment rights is a question of law rather than a factual issue. As such it is not susceptible of being stipulated to.</p>
<h4 align="left"><b>The position of the Union</b></h4>
<p>The Union contends that Mr. Rodriguez was discharged for asserting his privilege against self-incrimination. He was not required to give a statement unless he was offered <i>Garrity</i> immunity from prosecution based on his statement. The Union also asserts that Mr. Rodriguez has demonstrated that he followed proper procedure on at least on two of the occasions where he left home to attend court hearings in the criminal matter involving his brother,</p>
<h4 align="center"><b>DECISION OF THE ARBITRATOR</b></h4>
<h4 align="left"><i><b>The right of Mr. Rodriguez to refuse to answer questions based on the privilege against self-incrimination</b></i></h4>
<p>In its Post-Hearing Brief the City has submitted a great deal of argument relating to evidence that might be appropriate in a proceeding relating to Mr. Rodriguez' involvement in the crime at the PCS Metro store. No criminal charges have been brought against Mr. Rodriguez: The Arbitrator made it clear at the evidentiary hearing the robbery/murder is not the subject of the current proceeding and the Arbitrator gives no weight to those arguments,</p>
<p>The Arbitrator further finds that the City had notice that Mr. Rodriguez was claiming his Fifth Amendment privilege. The City's assertion that Mr. Rodriguez did not assert his Fifth Amendment or <i>Garrity</i> rights is not born out by the record. This argument fails in the light of testimony of detective Valdes who witnessed his interview that he was aware of the Mr. Rodriguez' asserting the privilege. It is also reinforced by Mr. Jones' stipulation that Mr. Rodriguez asserted the privilege. Contrary to the argument of the City that the stipulation was a question of law that was not subject to stipulation the Arbitrator finds it is question of fact and that it adds further support to the finding that Mr. Rodriguez asserted his privilege against self-incrimination. Certainly there is no question that Mr. Rodriguez asserted his <i>Garrity</i> rights when his attorney stated that he would give a statement if was a <i>Garrity</i> statement.</p>
<h4 align="left"><b>Waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination</b></h4>
<p>In <i>Lefkowitz v. Turley</i>, 414 U.S. 70, 77 (1973) the Court noted the broad applicability of the privilege against self-incrimination. It reasoned that:</p>
<blockquote><p class="continued">The Amendment not only protects the individual against being involuntarily called as a witness against himself in a criminal proceeding but also privileges him not to answer official questions put to him in any other proceeding, civil or criminal, formal or informal where the answers might incriminate him in future criminal proceedings. <i>McCarthy v. Arndstein</i>, 266 U.S. 34 &hellip; squarely held that</p>
<p class="continued">&ldquo;(t)he privilege is not ordinarily dependent upon the nature of the proceedings in which the testimony is sought or to be used. It applies alike to civil and criminal proceedings, wherever the answer might tend to subject to criminal responsibility him who gives it. The privilege protects a mere witness as fully as one who is also a party defendant</p></blockquote>
<p>There can be no dispute that the privilege was available to Mr. Rodriguez. The Arbitrator further finds that Mr. Rodriguez' subscribing to the oath was not a waiver of either his Fifth Amendment rights or his <i>Garrity</i> rights.</p>
<p>In <i>McCarthy v. Arndstein</i>, 266 U.S. 34 (1924) the Court noted that:</p>
<blockquote><p class="continued">The Supreme Court has repeatedly made clear that purported waivers of fundamental constitutional guarantees are subject to the most stringent scrutiny. An effective waiver requires an &ldquo;intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.&rdquo; <i>Johnson v, Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458</i>, 464, <i>58 S.Ct. 1019 1023, 82 L.Ed, 1461 (1938).</i> Valid waivers &ldquo;not only must be voluntary but must be knowing, intelligent acts done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.&rdquo; <i>Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742</i>, 748, <i>90 S.Ct. 1463 1468, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970). Accord., United States v, Garcia, 517 F.2d 272</i>, 276 (5th Cir. 1975); <i>United States v. Escandar, 465 F.2d 438</i>, 441 (5th Cir. 1972). Because of the far-reaching consequences involved in a waiver of a basic right, &ldquo;Courts indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver of a fundamental right&hellip;.&rdquo; <i>United States y. Shea, 50ft F.2d</i> 85 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, <i>423 U.S. 847, 96. S.Ct 87, 46 L.Ed.2d 69 (1975)</i>. (The citations are in the original.)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>In <i>In re Bobby L. Bryan</i>, 645 F.2d 331, 333 (Fifth Cir. 1981) the court observed that:</p>
<p class="continued">The Supreme Court has repeatedly made clear that waivers of fundamental constitutional guarantees are subject to the most stringent scrutiny. &lsqb;&hellip;&rsqb; Valid waivers &lsquo;not only must be voluntary but must be knowing, intelligent acts done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances. Because of the far-reaching consequences involved in a waiver of a basic right, &lsquo;Courts indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver of a fundamental right&hellip;..&rsquo; (Internal Citations omitted.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The City has offered no evidence that Mr. Rodriguez, or any other police officer was on notice that subscribing to the oath was a waiver of Fifth Amendment or <i>Garrity</i> rights. The message the City seems to be sending is that no police officer is entitled to those rights. In the absence of due notice to the officers of such a waiver the position of the City is untenable, The Arbitrator finds that Mr. did not waive his Fifth Amendment or <i>Garrity</i> rights by subscribing to the oath.</p>
<h4 align="left"><b>The <i>Garrity</i> protections</b></h4>
<p>The effect of the <i>Garrity</i> decision on the employment relationship is summarized in <i>How Arbitration Works</i>, Elkouri and Elkouri, Sixth Edition at p. 1261:</p>
<blockquote><p class="continued">Although <i>Garrity</i> prohibits the use of compelled testimony in criminal proceedings, it does not prohibit interdepartmental inquiries or discipline including discharge. <i>Garrity</i> prohibits only the compulsion of testimony that has not been immunized. Thus employees may not be both compelled to make a statement and required to waive their Fifth Amendment rights. However compelled testimony may be used in subsequent civil and administrative proceedings, and public employees may be fired either for refusing to cooperate or on the basis of the statements they provide. (Internal citations omitted.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Rodriguez was entitled to decline to answer the City's inquiries without being afforded <i>Garrity</i> rights. Through his attorney he offered to do so. If he declined to respond after being afforded <i>Garrity</i> rights he would have been subject to discipline. The City in its judgment determined that it wanted to preserve the right to prosecute Mr. Rodriguez. Thus by preserving its opportunity to prosecute based on his statement it abandoned its right to inquire.</p>
<h4 align="left"><i><b>The issue of Mr. Rodriguez' alleged violations of his ROD status</b></i></h4>
<p>Mr. Rodriguez' handling of time away from home seems to be an afterthought of the City as a reason for his dismissal considering that it sat on his alleged repeated infractions for two and one-half years without addressing them. In fact the decision maker in his termination, Police Chief Rodolfo Lianes, testified that Mr. Rodriguez' declining to respond to interrogation was the reason for his dismissal. (Tr. 280). The Police Chiefs testimony did not mention the ROD matter as a reason for the dismissal.</p>
<p>While no time limit in the CBA for assessing discipline has been cited it would appear that the City sanctioned his conduct. Certainly the failure to discipline Mr. Rodrguez for the alleged infractions would have been available, as a precedent if a similar situation had been involved in another disciplinary matter involving the same type of infraction. Indeed the failure of the City to discipline the alleged infraction on October 24 would have been precedent for his permitting his subsequent acts. However the acts were addressed in the disciplinary memorandum Mr. Rodriguez received dated April 16, 2016 (Int. Ex. 4). He cannot claim surprise. Mr. Rodriguez was able to fully address those issues at the hearing and in his Post Hearing brief.</p>
<p>Paragraph 3 of the terms of Mr. Rodriguez ROD status provides, in part, &ldquo;If it becomes necessary to leave your residence for personal reasons, you must <i>first</i> call the Internal Affairs Commander <i>or his/her designee</i> for approval of use of your accumulated time and to obtain permission.&rdquo; (Emphasis supplied.) (Joint ex. 5). It is undisputed that Mr. Rodriguez was away from his home on October 24, 2013, November 21, 2013 (Tr. 197) and January 14, 2014 (Tr, 198). On all three of these occasions he attended court hearings in a criminal matter involving his brother. On occasions Mr. Rodriguez spoke by telephone to Detective Shanetta Green. (Tr. 174).</p>
<p>Detective Valdes testified as to the content of City payroll records for the days Mr. Rodriguez attended his brother's court hearings. The records show that Mr. Rodriguez was scheduled on duty on October 24, 2013. (City ex. 8, Tr. 80, 81) and that Mr. Rodriguez was paid for eight hours on that day. However on October 29 the clerk made an adjustment to show that Mr. Rodriguez was paid for vacation time. (City Ex. 8, testimony of Detective Valdez at Tr. 81, 82).</p>
<p>The City's payroll records for November 25, 2013 show Mr. Rodriguez as on duty on November 21, 2015, (City ex. 13, Detective Valdes, Tr. 91), However the record shows it was changed on November 22, whereon the payroll record was modified (Tr. 90-91). Ms. Doris Quevedo made the audits. (Tr. 151, 154). The audit changes the record to indicate that Mr. Rodriguez was on leave with pay on November 23, 2013, partly on vacation and partly on comp time. (Tr, 151, 156).</p>
<p>While Mr. Rodriguez was on the City payroll he was accountable for his time and whereabouts. While he was using comp time or vacation time that is not the case.</p>
<p>The City's payroll record for January 16, 2014 shows Mr. Rodriguez was paid for that day. No edit was made to that document (Tr. 159).</p>
<p>Curiously Mr. Rodriguez was never informed that there was any question relating to his whereabouts until he received a reprimand in April of 2016, It was only then that he was accused of committing any violations of the conditions of his ROD status. (City ex, 4, Tr. 201). Thus the City sat on these alleged infraction for over two years without giving Mr. Rodriguez the opportunity to respond. (City ex. 14, Tr. 158-59). Mr. Rodriguez testified that in two of the three instances he notified the city and he was charged with vacation or comp time (Tr. 275). His testimony did not account for the incident on January 16, 2014,</p>
<p>For the dates of October 24, 2013 and November 21, 2013 the records were changed subsequent to their initial entries to show that he was properly using his own time for being away from home on those days. There is no evidence that Mr. Rodriguez did, or could have altered those records. The City did not call Detective Green or Doris Quevedo to testify as to the reasons for the changes in the records. In the face of Mr. Rodriquez' testimony that he properly sought use of personal time for those absences the records are not persuasive. Notably Chief Lianes testified that the tracking of records of officers who on ROD is subject to error. (Tr. 285-86).</p>
<p>Accordingly the Arbitrator finds that the City has failed to meet its burden of persuasion that Mr. Rodriguez was not on his own time rather than on City Payroll on October 24, 2013 and November 21, 2013. The City records for October 24, 2013 and November 21, 2014 being uncorroborated by testimony of persons responsible for those entries does not fulfill the City's burden of persuasion for those days. Further the City has not established to whom it was necessary for Mr. Rodriguez to report his absence from home. The ROD memorandum, City Ex. 4, states the call must be made to the Internal Affairs Commander or his designee. Since Mr. Rodriguez made contacts with Detective Green without objection from the City. It was incumbent on the City to show whether or not Lieutenant Green was the Commander's designee.</p>
<p>There were no audits to the record for January 16, 2014 and no testimony of Mr. Rodriguez accounts for the propriety of his being away from home on the January 2014 date.</p>
<p>Accordingly the Arbitrator finds that Mr. Rodriguez did not violate the ROD terms on the two 2013 dates but that the City has met its burden of proving that he did not fulfill his ROD reporting requirements on January 16, 2014.</p>
<p>The Arbitrator further finds that the discipline of discharge was based improperly on his assertion of his Fifth Amendment rights and alleged failure to report his two 2013 occasions of being away from home. The Arbitrator finds that the failure of most of the bases for Mr. Rodriguez' discharge would have resulted in a lesser discipline than discharge and that he should be reinstated to his police officer position with service credit dating from his former date of employment with the City. The one violation of his ROD status on January 16, 2014 however does merit severe discipline. He therefore shall receive no compensation for the period during whicn he was dismissed.</p>
<h4 align="center"><i><b>Order of the Arbitrator</b></i></h4>
<p>Accordingly it is hereby ordered that:</p>
<blockquote><p class="continued">1. Mr. Rodriguez shall be reinstated forthwith to his position as a police officer with no loss of service credit for the purposes of determination of benefits to which he is entitled.</p></blockquote>
<h4 align="center"><i><b>This space is deliberately left vacant</b></i></h4>
<blockquote><p class="continued">2. Mr. Rodriguez shall receive no compensation for the period during which he was not on duty as a police officer.</p></blockquote>
