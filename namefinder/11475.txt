<p>IN THE MATTER OF THE ARBITRATION between TRANSDEV NORTH AMERICA, INC. Employer, and INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS, LOCAL 639, Union.</p>
<p>Arbitration Case</p>
<p>CASE &num; 16-53590-1</p>
<p>May 16, 2017.</p>
<p>Michael Wolf, Arbitrator</p>
<h4 align="center"><b><i>ISSUE</i></b></h4>
<p>The parties could not agree on a joint statement of the issue. The Union proposed:</p>
<blockquote><p class="continued">&lsqb;W&rsqb;hether the Grievant was discharged for cause and, if not, what shall be the remedy.? &lsqb;Tr at 9.&rsqb;</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The Employer alternatively proposed:</p>
<blockquote><p class="continued">&lsqb;D&rsqb;id the collective bargaining agreement prohibit the separation from employment based upon disqualification of the grievant, Randolph Taylor? <i>&lsqb;Id.&rsqb;</i></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">I conclude that the issues presented by the evidence and arguments are: Did the Employer have just cause to dismiss Grievant from service? If not, what is an appropriate remedy?</p>
<h4 align="center"><b><i>BACKGROUND</i></b></h4>
<p>The hearing in this case was held at the offices of the Employer (&ldquo;Transdev&rdquo; or &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) in Hyattsville, MD on January 12, 2017. A court reporter transcribed the testimony. The Employer called the following witnesses in support of its case: Julie Peel (Director of Safety and Training) and Patryce Hamilton (Paratransit operator and, previously, trainer). The Union called: Randolph Taylor (former Paratransit operator) and Scott Clark (Union business agent). The parties also introduced documentary exhibits into evidence. The following summary of the facts is derived from the testimonial and documentary evidence in the record.</p>
<p>In 2012, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (&ldquo;WMATA&rdquo; or &ldquo;Metro&rdquo;) awarded a contract to Veolia Transportation to operate its MetroAccess program, which provides paratransit services to persons with disabilities. Veolia began work under the contract in 2013 and entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the Union with the effective dates June 26, 2013 through June 30, 2016. As a result of changes to the parent company's corporate structure, Transdev succeeded Veolia as Employer under the collective bargaining agreement; the parties' relevant rights and obligations under the collective bargaining agreement did not otherwise change.</p>
<p>Grievant was hired as a paratransit bus driver (operator) by Transdev on March 9, 2015. He previously had worked as a Metro paratransit driver for a predecessor contractor, but had not worked in that position since mid-2013. Between 2013 and March 2015, Grievant drove a school bus for a private company. As a new employee at Transdev, Grievant was given the standard three weeks of training that the Company requires of all new operators. At the end of the training, Grievant was given both written and practical (behind-the-wheel) tests on multiple skills required of a driver, including safety components of the job.</p>
<p>Grievant passed the overall testing, although records show that he did not pass all of the test components on all of the days during which he was evaluated. For example, in the driving standards test on March 23, 2015, the instructor &ldquo;failed&rdquo; Grievant on the following test components: &ldquo;use of brakes and anticipated stops,&rdquo; &ldquo;defensive driving,&rdquo; &ldquo;right turns,&rdquo; &ldquo;left turns,&rdquo; &ldquo;crossing intersections&rdquo; and &ldquo;commentary driving.&rdquo; On March 26, Grievant passed all of these tests, except he again failed &ldquo;right turns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The part of the safety training at issue in this case involves &ldquo;securement&rdquo; of wheelchairs inside the vehicle. When a passenger is in a wheelchair, the driver must not only place the wheelchair inside the vehicle, but he/she must also ensure that the chair is stable during the ride by means of various mechanical restraints. For example, the wheelchair is placed in a special track on the floor of the vehicle and special straps are affixed to the chair so that it cannot tip over or move during a ride. Grievant failed the &ldquo;wheelchair securement&rdquo; test on March 24, 2015 because he was too slow. However, he passed this test on March 26, and he ultimately passed all of the evaluations necessary to begin service.</p>
<p>On August 15, 2016, Grievant was involved in an accident in which he had changed lanes from left to right in preparation for a right-hand turn, but he had not seen another vehicle already in the right-hand lane; the two vehicles collided, with the other vehicle striking Grievant in the rear. Damage to the vehicles was slight, and no driver or passenger was injured. However, the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department issued Grievant a citation.</p>
<p>The accident was reviewed a week later by supervisors, including Peel. The Safety Department report noted</p>
<blockquote><p class="continued">MACS &lsqb;MetroAccess&rsqb; operator changing lane without ensuring the lane was clear before moving into lane.</p></blockquote>
<p>MACS operator could have used his mirrors to prevent the accident. The Safety Department deemed this a &ldquo;preventable&rdquo; accident, meaning that Grievant was responsible for the accident. Under the Company's Safety Policies and Procedures, Grievant was required to attend re-training because of his involvement in a preventable accident.</p>
<p>Peel testified that re-training after accidents is normally no more than 3 hours, but Grievant's training and evaluation stretched over three days because he had trouble passing several components of the testing. Although Grievant passed the class room and diagnostic reviews, he initially failed to pass the behind-the-wheel portion of the training. He was given another behind-the-wheel evaluation on the next day, but again he did not pass. Finally, he was tested on the third day with a different evaluator, and this time he passed. He thereafter returned to service.</p>
<p>On November 30, 2015, Grievant had another accident that was also deemed preventable. On this occasion, Grievant was stopped behind a vehicle waiting to merge onto Central Avenue in Capital Heights, MD. As the other vehicle moved forward in apparent readiness to merge, Grievant looked to the side to better see the flow of traffic on Central Avenue. As he did so, he started to move forward slowly in order to complete his own merge. However, he failed to see that the vehicle in front of him had stopped again before entering Central Avenue. As a result, Grievant struck the rear end of the other vehicle. At the time, Grievant had one passenger; neither Grievant nor the passenger was injured.</p>
<p>Peel met with Grievant after the November accident and warned him that Company policy required automatic termination if there are three preventable accidents within a 24-month period. Because Grievant already had two preventable accidents in less than a year, she recommended that he again complete the full training program. Grievant agreed to do so, although at the hearing he expressed reservations about the fairness of this requirement.</p>
<p>After completing the classroom training, Grievant was given behind-the-wheel training on December 16, 2015. He failed three different components of the checklist (pre-trip planning, left turns and right turns). On December 22, Grievant was re-tested and passed all of the components of the re-training except one: wheelchair securement. The test was administered by Hamilton, and she determined that he had failed all three efforts at wheelchair securement. On his first try, Hamilton found that Grievant had placed the loops of the web restrainer on the front tires of the wheelchair, when the loops are supposed to be attached to the frame of the chair. Grievant testified that he never puts the loops of the web belt on the wheels and that Hamilton was simply wrong to fail him for this reason.</p>
<p>In his second effort to secure the chair, Hamilton stated in her written report that Grievant &ldquo;did not make sure the tie downs &lsqb;were&rsqb; secure. I was able to pull the front right tie down out &lsqb;of&rsqb; the floor.&rdquo; At the hearing, Grievant did not dispute these facts.</p>
<p>On the third effort, Hamilton found that Grievant had not made the straps on the chair sufficiently tight so that it did not move. She made the following entry in her report: &ldquo;&lsqb;Grievant&rsqb; did not make sure it was tight. I could wiggle the chair and get at least 6 clicks out of the tie down.&rdquo;<ftnote num="1"><para><quote>Clicks</quote> refer to the fact that the web restraints are tightened by a ratchet mechanism that makes clicking noises.</para></ftnote> Grievant testified that this criticism was unfair because the wheelchair used for the test was, in his words, &ldquo;flimsy.&rdquo; He stated that, when Hamilton continued to tighten the webbing, she could do so only because the wheels of the chair themselves were pulled inward by the force of the restraint. He stated that he did not tighten the wheelchair more than he did because he was afraid he would damage the chair.</p>
<p>Two days after the December 22, 2015 examination, Peel informally advised Grievant that his employment would likely be terminated. On January 4, 2016, Peel met with Grievant and formally notified him that he was being discharged because he could not satisfy one of the mandatory requirements of his job. A Union steward was present for the meeting. The written notification stated:</p>
<blockquote><p class="continued">Transdev Management officials have &lsqb;&rsqb; made a determination that you have not passed all requirements in conjunction with your re-training in a satisfactory manner. Transdev North America is terminating your employment at this time.</p></blockquote>
<p>Grievant and the Union did not wait for the final termination notice to initiate the grievance process. On December 24, 2015, immediately after Grievant's conversation with Peel, the following grievance was filed:</p>
<blockquote><p class="continued">Company is stating &lsqb;Grievant&rsqb; failed to successfully complete wheelchair retrain&lsqb;in&rsqb;g. As a result &lsqb;Grievant&rsqb; is looking to be reinstated and made whole. &lsqb;Grievant&rsqb; also does not feel he was properly retrained.</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">After the grievance was not resolved at earlier steps of the grievance process, I was selected as Arbitrator.</p>
<h4 align="center"><b><i>THE EMPLOYER'S POSITION</i></b></h4>
<p>The Employer's principal arguments can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>1. The grievance is untimely to the extent it argues that Transdev violated the collective bargaining agreement and the Company's safety policies by requiring Grievant to undergo a complete re-training in December 2015. Under the contract, a grievance must be initiated by an employee within 10 scheduled working days after notice or knowledge of the grievable event. Grievant had notice of the requirement of full re-training soon after the accident on November 30, 2015. The grievance filed on December 24, 2015 was not submitted within 10 scheduled working days of his notice of the re-training requirement.</p>
<p>2. The Union incorrectly argues that Transdev waived its arbitrability argument. The Company was not required to assert this argument at the Step 2 hearing, since the Union's object at that hearing was to address the termination, not the re-training.</p>
<p>3. The grievance states that Grievant &ldquo;does not feel he was properly retrained.&rdquo; That language did not put Transdev on notice that the Union would argue that it was improper to require Grievant to undergo the <i>full</i> re-training. The arbitration should therefore be limited to the facts giving rise to Grievant's termination (i.e., his failure to successfully complete the behind-the-wheel evaluation).</p>
<p>4. Transdev did not violate Section C.7 of its Safety Policy. Grievant admitted that he was given a one-day re-training as required by Section C.7.</p>
<p>5. Although Grievant expressed dissatisfaction with Peel's recommendation that he undergo three weeks of training, he in fact agreed to this requirement without filing a grievance when she raised the issue.</p>
<p>6. Management retains the right to determine work standards under the collective bargaining agreement, and, therefore, it had the right to require Grievant to undergo a full three weeks of re-training. Nor was Grievant singled out for this requirement, since Peel testified that she frequently requires operators to undergo full re-training after an accident. Although the Union argued that there was no established past practice for full re-training, the Union offered no evidence to support this argument or to refute Peel's testimony.</p>
<p>7. Full re-training was appropriate in light of Grievant's accident record and his difficulty in successfully completing his re-training evaluation after the first accident.</p>
<p>8. Consistent with arbitral precedent, Transdev was not required to prove just cause for its decision. When an employee fails to maintain a necessary qualification for a job, the ensuing termination is not subject to due process or just cause standards.</p>
<p>9. In this case, Grievant was given re-training after his second accident, but still failed to pass his final evaluation. He was given three opportunities to pass the wheelchair securement portion of the test, and he failed all three tries. An employee who fails to maintain necessary qualifications for a job may properly be terminated.</p>
<p>10. Transdev proved by credible testimony that Grievant failed the wheelchair securement evaluation three times. The Union did not present credible evidence to rebut that testimony. The Union presented only the Grievant's testimony with regard to the test, but his explanation of the facts surrounding that test were contradictory and not credible.</p>
<p>11. Contrary to the Union's argument, Transdev had a right to test Grievant on wheelchair securement after his second accident. The parties have recognized that wheelchair securement is such a vital skill that an infraction can lead to immediate termination. The fact that wheelchair securement was not part of his November 30, 2015 accident does not mean that the Company must maintain his employment when he so clearly is unable after three tries to perform that duty.</p>
<p>12. Grievant's desire to retain his job was sufficient motivation for him to offer &ldquo;self-serving &lsquo;spin&rsquo;.&rdquo; His testimony should not be credited. The Company's witnesses, in contrast, displayed no motive to lie about their and Grievant's actions.</p>
<p>13. Clark's testimony that the Company's past practice has been not to require full re-training after accidents should not be credited in light of Clark's admission that the Union is not notified when an employee is placed in post-accident re-training. The Union does not know how often the full re-training is required. Clark's credibility is also put into question by his notes of the Step 2 meeting; those notes do not contain any record of Management's arguments in response to the Union's claims.</p>
<h4 align="center"><b><i>THE UNION'S POSITION</i></b></h4>
<p>The Union's principal arguments can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>1. The Employer improperly attempts to shift the burden of proof to the Union by calling this a &ldquo;separation&rdquo; case, rather than a discharge case. However, the grievance alleges unjust discharge and cites the provision of the collective bargaining agreement that addresses discipline and discharge. Moreover, the written notice given to Grievant on January <b>4,</b> 2016 is titled an &ldquo;Employee Disciplinary Report&rdquo; and states that the Company is &ldquo;terminating your employment at this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2. Regardless of the terminology the Company tries to use, it &ldquo;fired&rdquo; Grievant and such action must be adjudged under the just cause standard, with the burden of proof on the Employer.</p>
<p>3. The Employer had the burden of not only proving that it was justified in disciplining Grievant, but also that it was justified in imposing the ultimate punishment of termination.</p>
<p>4. The collective bargaining agreement incorporates the Company's Safety Policies, which, in turn, provide that post-accident training will be limited to the cause of the accident. This language is plain and unambiguous. After the November 30, 2015 accident, the Company insisted that Grievant be re-trained, not on the root cause of the accident, but on all aspects of his job, including those unrelated to the accident. This requirement violated the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p>5. The November 30, 2015 accident did not involve a wheelchair or any problem with Grievant's ability to secure a wheelchair. It was therefore improper to train and test him on wheelchair securement. It follows that the Employer could not terminate him for failing the wheelchair securement test.</p>
<p>6. The Arbitrator should reject the Employer's effort to restrict the scope of the grievance by excluding the Union's argument about the improperly broad scope of the re-training. The grievance explicitly alleged that Grievant had received improper retraining.</p>
<p>7. The Employer's objection to arbitration of the full re-training requirement should also be rejected because: (a) the Employer failed to comply with its contractual obligation to notify the Union of Grievant's re-training and (b) it failed to make this argument until the day of the arbitration hearing. By not raising the procedural arbitrability argument during prior phases of the grievance, the Employer &ldquo;denie&lsqb;d&rsqb; the union a fair opportunity to prepare its case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>8. The Arbitrator should reject the Company's argument that Grievant agreed with Peel to undergo the full re-training. The Employer had no right to circumvent the Union and bargain directly with an employee. Nor did the Employer give Grievant adequate notice that his failure of the full re-training could result in discipline.</p>
<p>9. The fact that Grievant had two accidents did not provide an exception to the rule that the Employer may only re-train employees on the cause of the accident. The Safety Policies (and hence the contract) do not create an exception based on the number of prior accidents.</p>
<p>10. The Safety Policies state that a driver may only be terminated after three preventable accidents. In this case, the Employer is improperly trying to enforce termination after only two accidents.</p>
<p>11. Under the principles of just cause, the Employer should only be permitted to impose a level of discipline that is commensurate with the seriousness of the alleged offense and that is corrective. It is not reasonable for the Company to fire Grievant under the facts of this case. He has driven for MetroAccess for four years with no evidence of a problem with wheelchair securement. It is &ldquo;patently unfair&rdquo; to now discharge Grievant for failing a training component that was not warranted in the first place.</p>
<h4 align="center"><b><i>FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS</i></b><ftnote num="2"><para>Both parties cited numerous arbitration awards in support of their positions. For the sake of concision, I do not discuss all of those awards, but they have all been read and have informed my decision-making below.</para></ftnote></h4>
<h4 align="left"><b><i>Was the Grievance Untimely to the Extent It Contested the Requirement that Grievant Undergo Full Re-Training?</i></b></h4>
<p>The Employer contends that the Union's grievance should be limited to the termination issue. It argues that the grievance did not expressly contest the requirement of full re-training and that, even if it did, such a complaint would have been untimely. It points out that Grievant knew about the re-training requirement on or about November 30, 2015, while the grievance was not filed until December 24, 2015.</p>
<p>Article 16 of the collective bargaining agreement prescribes the procedures for grievance resolution and states at Step 1:</p>
<blockquote><p class="continued">The aggrieved employee or employees must present the grievance to a Shop Steward and Company within ten (10) scheduled working days after knowledge of the grievance or the reason for the grievance has occurred&hellip;.</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The Employer argues, citing precedent, that Arbitrators must enforce contracts as written, including time deadlines for the filing and processing of grievances. I agree that Arbitrators are not empowered to impose their own sense of equity with regard to deadlines; absent ambiguity, a contract's language should be enforced as written.</p>
<p>However, the Company is too dismissive of the Union's contention that the Employer has waived its timeliness argument by failing to raise it until the arbitration hearing. It put into evidence notes that Clark took at the earlier grievance hearing, which show that the Union protested the full re-training: &ldquo;The Union argues the decision to send Mr. Taylor back to full retraining.&rdquo; The Union notes that the Company's answer to the grievance at Step 2 made no mention that it considered this argument untimely. The Company, in turn, contends that Clark's notes are self-serving and not credible, especially since the notes do not record any of the Company's responses.</p>
<p>I find that the Union's notes from the grievance meeting are credible, albeit limited, and that they show the Union protesting the re-training regimen required of Grievant. The Company's written response to Grievant, dated February 22, 2016, does not contain any objection to the timeliness of the grievance.</p>
<p>The collective bargaining agreement constructs a multi-step grievance process designed to resolve grievances short of arbitration. The parties' thereby expressed a preference for settlement rather than litigation. However, settlement becomes a chimera if one party conceals its arguments and waits until arbitration to spring a new argument on its opponent. Settlements are unattainable if a party fails to put all its &ldquo;cards&rdquo; on the table during the pre-arbitration grievance process.</p>
<p>Contrary to the Employer's assertion, I conclude that Article 16 of the contract did require it to disclose its arbitrability arguments prior to arbitration. Only by doing so could the Employer respect the contract's preference for the settlement of disputes. I therefore reject the Employer's argument that the Union's grievance was untimely with respect to the request that Grievant undergo full re-training. It waived this procedural arbitrability argument by failing to raise it prior to arbitration.</p>
<h4 align="left"><b><i>Did the Grievance Fail to Put Transdev on Notice that the Union Was Contesting the Decision to Require Full Re-Training?</i></b></h4>
<p>The Employer also complains that the grievance did not put it on notice that the Union would contest the decision to require full re-training for Grievant after the November 30, 2015 accident. I reject that contention. Grievances are not supposed to have the precision of federal court pleadings. In this case, both the grievance and the Step 2 hearing gave sufficient notice to Transdev that the Union was contesting both the dismissal and the re-training decision that led to the dismissal.</p>
<h4 align="left"><b><i>Was Grievant's Dismissal Subject to a Just Cause Standard?</i></b></h4>
<p>The Employer contends that this is a case involving a &ldquo;separation&rdquo; based on a failure to meet the basic qualifications of the job and that such a separation does not require proof of just cause. The Employer notes that, under Article 4, Management retains the right to &ldquo;determine work standards&rdquo; and to &ldquo;determine whether employees meet said standards.&rdquo; It argues that this is a case where it has set training and competency standards, and Grievant failed to satisfy those standards.</p>
<p>The collective bargaining agreement in this case has a provision that is both explicit and broad in its adoption of the just cause standard. Article 15 states that an &ldquo;employee shall not be disciplined <i>or dismissed from service</i> nor shall entries be made against the employee's record without just cause.&rdquo; Under this provision, any employee &ldquo;dismissed from service&rdquo; is entitled to be adjudged under the just cause standard. There is no exception stated or implied for a dismissal based on poor performance or qualification issues. Moreover, this is not a case where an employee failed to satisfy an externally imposed qualification, such as a driver's license.<ftnote num="3"><para>This fact distinguishes the decision in <italic>Cobb County Transit and ATU Local 732</italic>, 15-2 ARB &para;6468 (2015), which is cited in Transdev's brief.</para></ftnote> The training and evaluation criteria were created by Transdev and are administered by Transdev personnel. Transdev's own actions and judgments were essential to the termination decision. In this context, the Employer must prove that its actions followed appropriate norms of due process and just cause for Grievant's dismissal.<ftnote num="4"><para>The Company has cited cases for the proposition that just cause is irrelevant in cases of an employee's failure to meet qualification standards. I have read those cases, but the decision in this case must be based on the collective bargaining agreement before me, not on contractual language in other cases presenting entirely different facts.</para></ftnote></p>
<p>I conclude that, under the facts presented, just cause applies to this case. As a result, Transdev must prove that: (1) it had established reasonable training/testing requirements; (2) it properly applied those requirements to Grievant; (3) Grievant failed to satisfy those requirements; and (4) dismissal was a just response to Grievant's failure to pass the wheelchair securement test.</p>
<h4 align="left"><b><i>Did Transdev Have Reasonable Training and Testing Requirements?</i></b></h4>
<p>The parties' collective bargaining agreement defines Management's rights at Article 4. It includes the right to create &ldquo;reasonable rules, orders and regulations issued by the Company not contrary to or in conflict with this agreement.&rdquo; Section 2 lists additional specific rights, including:</p>
<blockquote><p class="continued">To determine work standards, the quality and quantity of work performed by employees, and to determine whether employees meet said standards.</p>
<p class="continued">To establish policies, reasonable rules, regulations, organizational structure and procedures, which do not conflict with the terms of this Agreement.</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Pursuant to these provisions, Transdev has published a 43-page manual of Safety Policies and Procedures that includes extensive discussion of training and testing requirements for bus operators. While there is a dispute over how those procedures were applied to Grievant in this case, neither the Grievant nor the Union has contested the existence or reasonableness of these Policies and Procedures. Nor has Grievant disputed his knowledge of the rules.</p>
<h4 align="left"><b><i>Did Transdev Properly Apply the Training Requirements to Grievant?</i></b></h4>
<p>The Grievant's main argument is that the full re-training regimen was improperly imposed on Grievant after his November 30, 2015 accident. The Union points to several provisions of the Safety Policies and Procedures that address post-accident training. One example, is found at Paragraph F.22 of the manual:</p>
<blockquote><p class="continued"><b>Post-accident training</b> will <b>be provided to employees involved in a preventable accident.</b></p>
<p class="continued">Post-accident training content will be based on the root cause of the accident.</p>
<p class="continued">Post-accident training will include, at a minimum, one hour of Behind the Wheel instruction.</p>
<p class="continued">A satisfactory final evaluation (SPP 3.4) must be completed before an Operator returns to review service.</p>
<p class="continued">Employees must complete post-accident training prior to returning to driving duties.<ftnote num="5"><para>Other paragraphs in the manual contain similar language.</para></ftnote></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The Union interprets this language to mean that &ldquo;post-accident training will be <i>limited to</i> the cause of the accident.&rdquo; U.Br. at 7-8 (emphasis added). It argues that, since Grievant's accident on November 30 had nothing to do with wheelchair securement, it was improper to test him on that component of the evaluation process. There are two main defects in the Union's argument.</p>
<p>First, the Union dismisses the fact that Grievant himself agreed to follow Peel's recommendation that he pursue the full training in order to avoid a third preventable accident, which could lead to automatic termination. I find that Peel was trying to help Grievant preserve his employment; she was not trying to set him up for failure. She did not mislead him. In this endeavor, Grievant agreed with Peel's suggestion. Grievant's testimony at the arbitration hearing that he disagreed with Peel's recommendation comes too late and is not believable. He agreed to the re-training, and I will not now reject the arrangement that Peel and Grievant thought was reasonable at the time.<ftnote num="6"><para>The Union argues that Management illegally bypassed the Union by negotiating directly with an individual employee. That argument must be rejected. The re-training was mandated by the Safety Policies and Procedures, which was incorporated into the collective bargaining agreement by Article 37. The scope of the re-training was a matter of Management discretion under Article 4. The discussion between Peel and Grievant after the November 2015 accident was not disciplinary in nature and did not require the presence of a Union official. Nor was there a due process violation. Grievant could have consulted the Union after his meeting with Peel, just as he did after the December 24 meeting.</para></ftnote></p>
<p>Second, the Union mischaracterizes the meaning of the language in Paragraph F.22 of the Safety Policies. It does not say that post-accident re-training is strictly &ldquo;limited to&rdquo; the cause of the accident, as the Union argues in its brief. <b>Instead,</b> it states that the re-training should be &ldquo;<i>based on</i> the root cause of the accident.&rdquo; That language is not nearly as restrictive as the Union would have it.</p>
<p>When Grievant was retrained after his August 15, 2015 accident, he was not retrained only on changing lanes, which was the cause of the accident. He was given classroom training on five different subjects and received behind-the-wheel evaluations on multiple driving skills that had nothing to do with changing lanes. For example, he was tested on four different components of the &ldquo;pre-trip inspection&rdquo; and six different components of the &ldquo;preparing to drive&rdquo; part of the test. None of those skills was implicated in his August accident. Grievant did not file a grievance over having to complete those evaluations.</p>
<p>In Grievant's November 30, 2015 accident, he caused an accident because he was not paying attention while trying to merge from one road to another. The &ldquo;root cause&rdquo; of the accident was not merely a lack of skill completing a merge. Rather, the accident was caused by Grievant's inattention to his surroundings. The same could be said of his August 15 accident &mdash; he wasn't paying attention to other vehicles. In that circumstance, Management must be accorded some leeway in deciding what level of re-training is appropriate to ensure that there would not be a recurrence.</p>
<p>Grievant had proved himself to be a careless driver, resulting in two preventable accidents within the space of a few months. He failed several components of his initial, new-hire training, including wheelchair securement, before eventually passing the evaluations. In his training after the August 2015 accident, he again struggled to complete the test, failing multiple components of the evaluation before succeeding on his third try. Even if Grievant had not agreed to the full re-training in December 2015 and Management had demanded it, I would find nothing unreasonable in Peel's insistence that Grievant go back to first principles and be made to re-learn all of the necessary driving skills. That decision fell within Management's right &ldquo;to determine whether employees meet &lsqb;work&rsqb; standards.&rdquo; Art. 4, &sect;2.<ftnote num="7"><para>I also note that an improperly secured wheelchair is unlikely to be the root cause of an accident. It may be the cause of injury after an accident, but rarely would it be the direct cause of an accident. Taking the Union's interpretation of the Safety manual to its logical conclusion, re-training on wheelchair securement would never be appropriate unless the wheelchair actually caused the accident. That position is untenable, given Management's overall right to set safety standards and to determine whether employees meet those standards.</para></ftnote></p>
<h4 align="left"><b><i>Did Grievant Fail His Evaluation?</i></b></h4>
<p>The training records, buttressed by Hamilton's testimony, show that Grievant failed the wheelchair securement test three times, at which point Grievant was deemed to have failed the overall training. In his testimony, Grievant contested the accuracy of Hamilton's assessments on two of the wheelchair test. I credit Hamilton in this respect and find that Grievant did indeed fail the wheelchair test three times.</p>
<h4 align="left"><b><i>Did Transdev Have Just Cause to Remove Grievant from His Driving Duties?</i></b></h4>
<p>At first glance, the decision to discharge Grievant can seem petty. He passed all of his re-training and examination requirements except one. Why didn't Management simply give Grievant another shot at taking the wheelchair securement test? There is no allegation that Grievant's two accidents involved wheelchair malfunctions and there is no dispute that he ultimately passed the wheelchair securement test when he went for his original training in March 2015. On the other hand, there are several factors in this case that work against Grievant. First, he is a relatively short-term employee, having been employed by Transdev for less than one year.<ftnote num="8"><para>The Union asserts in its brief that Grievant was a MetroAccess driver for four years. However, he had not been a MetroAccess driver between 2013 and the time of his hiring by Transdev on March 9, 2015. There are no records in this case showing Grievant's driving or training record for his prior employers. I will only assess just cause in this case based on Grievant's training and driving record with Transdev and therefore must consider him a short-term employee for purposes of just cause.</para></ftnote> Second, Grievant showed that he had struggled with the wheelchair securement test even during his initial training in March 2015. He failed his first effort at that task because he was too slow. Third, Grievant was given three separate opportunities to pass the wheelchair securement test in December 2015. All were failures.</p>
<p>How many tries must an employee be afforded to complete retraining and testing, especially after having two accidents? Does just cause require five tries? Ten tries? Training and re-training costs money. Productivity is impacted negatively when a driver is pulled off the road following an accident. Peel testified that Grievant had already spent more time in training and re-training since he had gone to work for Transdev than any other employee. At some point, after reasonable effort has been made to ensure that an employee can perform basic functions, an Arbitrator must allow the Employer some level of discretion in saying that multiple failures leave it without sufficient faith that the employee is capable of learning and carrying out those functions in real-world situations.</p>
<p>Was it unreasonable for Transdev to declare that it could not risk further uncertainty and difficulty (and potential liability) while Grievant was responsible for driving disabled passengers through the metropolitan area? There is no evidence in this record that Transdev acted in bad faith; there is no evidence of an ulterior or improper motive. The Company reasonably decided that it did not wish to devote further training time and resources to Grievant; it was not confident, in light of his prior driving and training record, that he could provide safe rides to wheelchair-bound passengers.<ftnote num="9"><para>As a contractor for Metro, Transdev would understandably want to present the best possible safety record to Metro in order to preserve its contract. Transdev could also consider the potential legal consequences of a decision to retain Grievant notwithstanding his failure to complete re-training successfully. How would it look if Grievant was retained in the job and then was involved in another accident in which a wheelchair-bound passenger was injured? Discovery in subsequent litigation would undoubtedly turn up the fact that this Grievant had failed his wheelchair securement test three times in December 2015 and once in March 2015.</para></ftnote></p>
<p>Just cause is an elastic concept that must be applied to a multitude of factual situations. This is not an ordinary disciplinary case. Instead, it is akin to a performance-based termination. Although the failure to complete the wheelchair securement evaluation triggered the discharge, the training itself was required because of Grievant's poor driving performance leading to two accidents. In this circumstance, just cause must give some leeway to the Employer to set reasonable safety standards and to define reasonable efforts by employees to meet those standards.</p>
<p>When the facts, the contract and the Safety Policies are taken into consideration, I conclude that Transdev had just cause to remove Grievant from the position of bus driver. It was not obligated to continue the expenditure of time and money to repeatedly re-train Grievant. It had the right to say enough is enough after the evaluation failure in December 2015. It was not required to risk passenger safety by continuing to train and re-train a relatively new employee with this kind of safety track record.</p>
<p>Under the Company's Safety Policies, a driver may not be returned to driving duties unless he/she successfully completes post-accident training. In this case, I have found that Grievant did not successfully complete the post-accident training. Because Grievant failed the wheelchair securement test, he was properly removed from the position of bus operator.</p>
<p>The Union additionally argues that Grievant was not given notice of potential discipline in the event he failed the training. That argument is also rejected. The Safety Policies and Procedures explicitly state that an employee cannot be returned to driving duties until post-accident re-training is completed. Obviously, that requirement must mean satisfactory completion of the evaluation process that concludes the training. Since this caution is in writing, Grievant must be presumed to have read and understood it. In addition, Grievant had already been required to undergo re-training after the August 2015 accident. That experience would have put him on notice that a driver would not be permitted to work on the road until after satisfactory completion of the post-accident, behind-the-wheel evaluation. Further &ldquo;notice&rdquo; during the discussion between Peel and Grievant in November/December was unnecessary.</p>
<h4 align="left"><b><i>Did Transdev Have Just Cause to Terminate Grievant's Employment?</i></b></h4>
<p>Concluding that Transdev had just cause to remove Grievant from the position of bus operator is not the same as saying there was just cause to terminate his employment, since the Company employed other classifications of employees within the Union's jurisdiction. See CBA, Art. 1. The principle of just cause requires not only that an employer prove the facts leading to discharge; it must also prove that the termination of employment is appropriate.</p>
<p>As in performance-based actions, there remains the question whether it was reasonable for Transdev to completely remove Grievant from the payroll. He could be disqualified as a driver in light of his driving and training record, but was there just cause to exclude Grievant from all jobs with Transdev? Were there other jobs in the bargaining unit that were available and was Grievant competent to fill those jobs? Should he have been transferred or demoted to another job rather than being dismissed from service altogether?</p>
<p>Counsel for Transdev represented at the hearing that Grievant had in fact been given &ldquo;unconditional offers of reinstatement that were made to Mr. Taylor to come and work as a utility employee.&rdquo; The utility workers move buses around the lot, fuel buses and clean buses. Counsel further represented that Grievant declined such a position. However, no documentary or testimonial evidence was provided to support this representation. Instead, at the end of the hearing, the parties agreed that any issue of remedy, including evidence of offers of reinstatement, should be postponed to a later day in the event that remedial questions need to be answered.</p>
<p>I have concluded that, given Grievant's record, removal as a paratransit operator did not violate the principles of just cause. At the same time, I cannot exclude the possibility that dismissal from the payroll was a disproportionate action and that some lesser action (e.g. transfer to another job, demotion) would have been appropriate and necessary to satisfy the requirements of just cause. Because of uncertainty whether lesser actions would have been contractually permissible or appropriate, I cannot make a final decision. I am therefore remanding this issue back to the parties to either resolve among themselves or, if no resolution is reached within 30 days, to return to me with additional evidence focused solely on this remaining issue. That evidence may be presented in the form of written submissions, including factual stipulations, or through testimony at a re-convened hearing.</p>
<h4 align="left"><b><i>AWARD</i></b></h4>
<p>Transdev's position that the grievance is partially non-arbitrable and that the principles of just cause do not apply to this case are rejected.</p>
<p>On the merits, the grievance is denied to the extent that the Union contests Grievant's removal from the position of paratransit bus operator. Transdev had just cause to remove Grievant from that position. However, I am withholding a final ruling on the question whether Transdev violated just cause by dismissing Grievant from the payroll entirely without the opportunity to transfer to a different position within the bargaining unit. The parties are asked to consult on this issue and determine whether they can reach a resolution. If the parties are unable to agree, either party may return to me within 30 days with a request that I address this remaining question.</p>
<h4 align="left"><b><i>SUPPLEMENTAL AWARD</i></b></h4>
<p>On March 23, 2017, I issued an award in this case which resolved all issues but one. I left open the possibility that the Employer should have offered Grievant another position with the Company, rather than terminating his services. The Award stated as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p class="continued">On the merits, the grievance is denied to the extent that the Union contests Grievant's removal from the position of paratransit bus operator. Transdev had just cause to remove Grievant from that position. However, I am withholding a final ruling on the question whether Transdev violated just cause by dismissing Grievant from the payroll entirely without the opportunity to transfer to a different position within the bargaining unit. The parties are asked to consult on this issue and determine whether they can reach a resolution. If the parties are unable to agree, either party may return to me within 30 days with a request that I address this remaining question.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Employer has now filed a &ldquo;Supplemental Post Arbitration Brief in Support of the Disqualification of Randolph Taylor &lsqb;Grievant&rsqb;.&rdquo; It argues that: (1) it &ldquo;was not obligated to place &lsqb;Grievant&rsqb; in a non-driving position after he was disqualified from &lsqb;a&rsqb; position as an Operator&rdquo; and (2) even if the Employer was so required, it had already offered Grievant a non-driving position and Grievant had rejected the offer.</p>
<p>The Union argues in response that this matter is moot because Grievant was offered a utility position subsequent to the issuance of my Award and has rejected that position: Grievant &ldquo;is electing not to seek reinstatement under the award in any event.&rdquo; The Union advised that, in light of these facts, it would not pursue the case further.</p>
<p>The facts appear to be that Grievant was offered a non-driving position prior to my Award and was again offered a position after the Award. In each instance, he declined the offer. I therefore conclude that Grievant is not entitled to any further relief. Nor is the Union seeking any further relief. In light of these facts, the Employer satisfied its obligations under the collective bargaining agreement and under the terms of my Award. I consider this case at an end.</p>
