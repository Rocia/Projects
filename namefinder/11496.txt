<p>Arbitration Case</p>
<p>AAA Case No. 01-16-0004-1863</p>
<p>April 30, 2017.</p>
<p>Michael W. Stutz, Arbitrator</p>
<h4 align="center"><b><i>AWARD of the ARBITRATOR</i></b></h4>
<p>The undersigned arbitrator, having been designated by the Parties pursuant to their collective bargaining agreement, and, having duly heard the proofs, allegations, and contentions of the Parties, AWARDS as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="continued"><b>1) The City did not have just cause to terminate the employment of Dale Eason, the grievant, but there was just cause for discipline.</b></p>
<p class="continued"><b>2) As remedy, the City shall: a) convert the grievant's termination to a three-day suspension without pay; b) reinstate the grievant to his position; and, c) make him whole for lost benefits under the Contract, including seniority, back pay, lost details and/or overtime, minus unemployment benefits and/or interim earnings, if any, plus legal interest.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<h4 align="center"><b><i>BACKGROUND</i></b></h4>
<p class="continued">Hearings in this matter were held on February 14 &amp; 15, 2017, in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, before the undersigned, appointed arbitrator by the parties, pursuant to their collective bargaining agreement, through the offices of the American Arbitration Association.</p>
<p class="continued">Timothy M. Burke, Esq. and Jared Burke, Esq. appeared for the Union. Fernand J. Dupere, Jr., Esq. represented the City.</p>
<p class="continued">A stenographic transcript of the hearings was taken and written closing arguments from both parties were received on March 31, 2017.</p>
<h4 align="center"><b><i>AGREED ISSUES</i></b></h4>
<p class="continued">The parties submitted the following questions to arbitration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="continued">1) Was there just cause to terminate the employment of Dale Eason?</p>
<p class="continued">2) If not, what shall the remedy be?</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 align="center"><b><i>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</i></b></h4>
<p class="continued">The City of Pittsfield (the &ldquo;City,&rdquo; &ldquo;Employer,&rdquo; or &ldquo;management&rdquo;) and Local 447, IBPO (the &ldquo;Union&rdquo;) are parties to a collective bargaining agreement that provides for arbitration of unresolved grievances.</p>
<p class="continued">This case concerns the City's decision to terminate a long-term police officer, with a record of prior discipline, for untruthfulness in an arrest report.</p>
<p class="continued">The City's 90-member police force, which serves a population of approximately 30,000 people, has only four or five non-Caucasian officers, according to the testimony of the grievant.</p>
<p class="continued">The Police Department (the &ldquo;Department&rdquo;) is headed by Chief Michael Wynn. The Chief has been a member of the Department since 1995. He rose through the ranks and became Chief nine years ago.</p>
<p class="continued">Dale Eason (the &ldquo;grievant&rdquo;) is a 20-year member of the Department, who, like the Chief, is African-American. He has a history of prior discipline, and was involved in a June 2015 arrest of the wife of a former Police Chief that received widespread notice in the press. An internal affairs investigation of the June 2015 arrest exonerated the grievant.</p>
<p class="continued">Chief Wynn recommended to Mayor Linda M. Tyler that the grievant be terminated for untruthfulness in his report of a February 2016 arrest. Mayor Tyler accepted the Chief's recommendation, and the grievant was discharged from employment by letter dated September 7, 2016, based on charges of:</p>
<ol type="digit" bind-char="period" bind-to="right-only">
<li><p>Conduct unbecoming an Officer;</p></li>
<li><p>Untruthfulness; and</p></li>
<li><p>Falsifying records</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="continued">The charges relate to three allegedly untruthful words in the grievant's report of the February 2016 arrest.</p>
<p class="continued">Chief Wynn testified that untruthfulness by a police officer always warrants termination because they credibly persuade judges and juries to convict defendants charged with crimes with their testimony in court.</p>
<p class="continued">Considerable evidence was submitted into the record about the February 2016 arrest, and the circumstances surrounding it. There was also testimony about t June 2015 arrest that resulted in news reports, an internal investigation that exonerated the grievant, threat of a lawsuit, including against the Chief, and a second investigation assigned by the Chief to himself and another officer. The Union argues that the June 2015 incident prejudiced the City against the grievant, and influenced its decision to terminate him.</p>
<p class="continued">In the February 2016 incident, the grievant and another officer were dispatched to a supermarket where security had witnessed a larceny and confronted the female suspect. The grievant arrested the suspect, and the other officer searched for the suspect's vehicle and her co-hort(s). The grievant removed the suspect from the back of his car to be photographed by the store. In his report, the grievant wrote that he removed the prisoner, &ldquo;for her safety.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="continued">Shortly after being placed in the back of my cruiser, the prisoner began <b><i>thrashing her body</i></b> around in the back seat, yelling that she didn't steal anything, and repeatedly calling me a &ldquo;fucking dumbass.&rdquo; <i><b>For her safety, I attempted to remove the prisoner from my vehicle and place her onto the ground</b></i> to control her body. At this point, the prisoner attempted to pull away from me, and stiffen her body up, making it hard to remove her from the vehicle. I was eventually able to remove her from the vehicle and place her on the ground&hellip;&hellip;.<i><b>Also, Big Y Security wanted to get a photo as part of their process</b></i>. I advised them that I would not bring the prisoner back into the store due to her behavior. They then attempted to get a photo while she was on the ground. I am not sure if they were able to do so due to her flailing around and yelling while she was still on the ground. A short time after removing her from the vehicle, she stopped flailing her body, however she continued to scream. I attempted to place &lsqb;the prisoner&rsqb; back into the vehicle. As I was doing so, &lsqb;the prisoner&rsqb; stiffened her body again up against the cruiser, making it hard to place her in the vehicle. I attempted to place her inside the vehicle by bending her body and placing her inside the vehicle.</p>
<p class="continued">&lsqb;Emphasis supplied&rsqb;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">When questioned during the investigation, the grievant acknowledged that he removed the prisoner from the back seat of his police cruiser to enable the supermarket security to photograph her, pursuant to a practice of photographing larceny suspects, which officers know about and facilitate. The store uses photographs of suspects to obtain trespass orders and to post in its stores.</p>
<p class="continued">The grievant admitted that he should not have removed the prisoner from the car to take her photograph. His use of force was reviewed by the internal affairs investigation, but he was not charged with any such violations.</p>
<p class="continued">The issues to be answered at arbitration concern whether the City had just cause to terminate the grievant for lying. In particular, the question presented is whether the three words, &ldquo;for her safety,&rdquo; were intentionally untruthful and, if so, whether the penalty of termination was appropriate under all of the circumstances.</p>
<p class="continued">The grievant denies that he lied, and claims he wasn't able to explain all of his reasons for removing the prisoner during the investigation. He testified that he removed his prisoner to allow her to be photographed, and he understands now that he should never have removed her from the back of the cruiser for a photograph, but, he explains that she also was kicking and thrashing around in the back of the car before she was removed.</p>
<p class="continued">After the prisoner's defense attorney obtained video of the incident from the supermarket, prosecutors dropped charges against the suspect<ftnote num="1"><para>A hearsay document in evidence suggests that the shoplifting charges were dropped by the prosecutor because of the grievant's report that he removed the prisoner for her safety.</para></ftnote> and provided the video to the Department. The Chief assigned an internal affairs investigation of the February 2016 arrest and the grievant's report to Lieutenant Michael Grady.</p>
<p class="continued">Lieutenant Grady testified that, after reviewing the videos of the arrest, removal of the prisoner from the car, the booking, and listening to the 911 call, he was concerned about why the prisoner was removed from the vehicle since the photograph could have been taken at the police station and sent to the market.</p>
<p class="continued">Lieutenant Grady's report concluded, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="continued">Based on my review of the exterior surveillance video from the Big Y Supermarket, Officer Eason's arrest report of the prisoner, all the radio transmissions regarding the arrest of the prisoner, the booking video of the prisoner, my conversation with the prisoner, my interview with Mr. Agustynowicz, and my interview with Officer Kitchener I believe that Officer Eason was untruthful about the events surrounding the arrest of the prisoner in his arrest report. I believe that Officer Eason used an excessive amount of force to remove the prisoner from his cruiser for no other reason than to allow Mr. Agustynowicz to get a photo of her. Mr. Agustynowicz stated that the officer asked him if he wanted Estes inside or outside of the cruiser for the picture. When the prisoner was forcefully removed from the cruiser and on the ground her upper body was held up by Officer Eason so the photograph could be taken. After the photograph was taken Officer Eason used an excessive amount of force to put the prisoner back into the cruiser.</p>
<p class="continued">Removing the prisoner from the cruiser so that Mr. Agustynowicz could get a picture of her is not a legitimate action of a Pittsfield Police Officer. It's Officer Eason's conduct that causes the prisoner to become upset when she is dragged onto the ground in front of the public. It would appear that the prisoner didn't want the humiliation of being photographed in handcuffs, on the ground, in the travel lane of the parking lot at the Big Y. Any force used by Officer Eason is excessive because it is his conduct that created the situation with the prisoner.</p>
<p class="continued">I don't believe the prisoner was forcefully removed from the cruiser because she was &ldquo;thrashing her body around in the back seat.&rdquo; There is no evidence she was &ldquo;thrashing her body around in the back seat&rdquo; on the video or in the audio recordings, nor does Mr. Agustynowicz state that. If she was out of control in the cruiser Officer Eason had Officer Kitchener right around the corner from him and he could have asked for assistance or he could have notified dispatch and immediately transported her to the station. The Big Y supermarket is approximately one half mile away from the station.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Lt. Grady testified at arbitration that the Big Y supermarket frequently applies for trespass orders against people caught stealing. They use photographs of suspects as part of this process.</p>
<p class="continued">Chief Wynn testified that the Department has no rule against removing a prisoner from the police cruiser.</p>
<p class="continued">Chief Wynn recommended termination of the grievant because his report that he removed the prisoner from the cruiser &ldquo;for her safety&rdquo; was not true. The grievant was not charged with violating the Department's use of force policy.</p>
<p class="continued">Colin D'Amour, Store Manager of the Big Y Supermarket, testified at arbitration, but was not interviewed by Lieutenant Grady's internal affairs investigation. Mr. D'Amour said that it is &ldquo;normal&rdquo; for them to photograph someone caught stealing in order to post such photo's in all of their stores. He showed good memory of the incident, and recalled that the prisoner was acting up in the back of the car before the grievant removed her.</p>
<p class="continued">The store's loss prevention manager, Mr. Agustynowicz, on the other hand, had far less memory of the incident at arbitration, and was not asked about the prisoner's conduct in the car before her removal during his interview by Lieutenant Grady in the internal affairs investigation.</p>
<p class="continued">The Chief testified that he has disputed internal affairs investigations that found officers' reports to have been untruthful, and, instead, concluded that the reports were inaccurately written. The Chief said the grievant's report was untruthful, not inaccurate. He acknowledged that the distinction between untruthful and inaccurate writing is subjective with an element of discretion. He denied that his personal relationship with the grievant affected his decision in this case.</p>
<p class="continued">Although the grievant was exonerated by an internal affairs investigation into the June 2015 arrest, the Chief's letter of recommendation to the Mayor to terminate the grievant for the February 2016 report nonetheless referred to it. The Chief wrote to the Mayor,</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="continued">Additionally, Officer Eason remains under investigation for his involvement in arrest involving a forced entry and use of force.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The Chief said that a second internal investigation of the June 2015 arrest is still open a year later. The City settled its civil liability with the victim of the incident.</p>
<p class="continued">Transcripts and recordings of the grievant's Internal Affairs interview about the February 2016 arrest were introduced in evidence at arbitration, along with color videos of the incident from the store's surveillance cameras, and audio recordings of police radio and dispatcher calls.</p>
<p class="continued">The Mayor set up a civil service hearing by Matthew Kerwood, whose hearing report stated that &ldquo;all the charges relate to the allegation that the grievant falsified the report about why he removed the prisoner from the police car.&rdquo; Mr. Kerwood recommended that the grievant be terminated.</p>
<p class="continued"><i>June 2015 Incident</i></p>
<p class="continued">The grievant and a colleague, Jen Brueckmann, were dispatched to the wrong address, where they encountered the wife of former Police Chief Stankiewicz, who produced a knife, and the grievant and Officer Brueckmann arrested her.</p>
<p class="continued">Publicity about this incident in local and state-wide newspapers quoted Captain Grainger as saying that the grievant and his colleague were &ldquo;toxic,&rdquo; and that the incident would not have happened with any other officers in the Department.</p>
<p class="continued">The Chief assigned the investigation of the June 2015 arrest to Lieutenant Maddalena, who exonerated both officers. Chief Wynn testified that Lieutenant Maddalena is capable, fair, and honest. Nonetheless, he initiated a second internal affairs investigation, assigned to himself and Lieutenant Traversa, due to Lieutenant Maddalena's inexperience as an internal affairs investigator. The second investigation was still active on the hearing date, February 15, 2017, which surprised the grievant, who had no notice of it.</p>
<p class="continued">On cross-examination, the Chief denied that this reassignment resulted from his disagreement with Lieutenant Maddalena's exoneration of the grievant, but he acknowledged that the fact he was named as a potential defendant in the case created a possible conflict for him as coordinator of the second internal affairs investigation.</p>
<p class="continued">The grievant testified he was upset by Captain Grainger's public comments, went to the Chief to ask him to investigate Captain Grainger, but no investigation was initiated. The Chief acknowledged that Captain Grainger's comments were unprofessional.</p>
<p class="continued">The Chief testified that the City settled a civil claim for damages from the victim of the June 2015 arrest.</p>
<p class="continued">Officer Brueckmann filed a complaint of discrimination with the MCAD that Union counsel represented at arbitration was about to be moved to another forum.</p>
<p class="continued">The Union also submitted documentary and testimonial evidence about three 2011 cases in which the Chief exercised discretion to reduce charges of untruthfulness and to impose reprimands. One case involved an officer on the drug task force charged with purchasing steroids who was suspended for five days.</p>
<h4 align="center"><b><i>POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES</i></b></h4>
<h4 align="left"><i>City:</i></h4>
<p class="continued">In its final argument, the City emphasizes the grievant's prior discipline record, including:</p>
<p class="continued">1) A 2011 charge of conduct unbecoming which resulted in the grievant's demotion from the detective bureau and a three-day suspension.</p>
<p class="continued">2) A second 2011 conduct unbecoming charge that resulted in a documented verbal reprimand.</p>
<p class="continued">3) 2012 counseling for neglect of duty.</p>
<p class="continued">4) 2013 verbal reprimand for unauthorized absences.</p>
<p class="continued">The City contends that the grievant was untruthful when he reported that he took the prisoner out of his cruiser for her safety. According to the City, it appears that the grievant wrote the report, &ldquo;to try and protect himself rather than be factually accurate.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="continued">The City points to evidence that the prisoner did not physically resist being put into the back of the car, and asserts that there is no evidence that supports the conclusion that the prisoner was removed from the car for her safety. Rather, she was removed solely to take her photograph for the store.</p>
<p class="continued">The grievant reported that the prisoner's removal was for her safety, but also the store wanted a photograph as part of their process.</p>
<p class="continued">The City says the grievant's report that he told the store manager that he would not bring the prisoner back into the store is also untruthful. The City wrote in its final argument,</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="continued">The statement by Officer Eason is designed to make it appear that he was being a responsible officer trying to avoid escalating the situation which of course is far from the truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The City argues that faulty memory cannot be to blame because the grievant wrote his report shortly after the incident.</p>
<p class="continued">According to the City, the Union seeks to deflect blame for the grievant's untruthfulness by showing that the prisoner is a liar and a criminal. The City notes that its case is based on the testimony of witnesses who are not liars or criminals.</p>
<p class="continued">The City concedes the prisoner's emotions escalated in the parking lot, and points to Lieutenant Grady's testimony that this was caused by the grievant's decision to remove the prisoner from the car. Lieutenant Grady said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="continued">&ldquo;I'd be pissed too getting ripped out of the car in the main thoroughfare at Big Y and having people walk by while you're getting held up to get a photograph of you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The City describes the grievant's actions towards the prisoner as,</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="continued">Humiliating, degrading and not worthy of an officer whose primary duty is to &ldquo;protect and serve&rdquo; the public.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The City points to case law that requires truthfulness of police officers at all times and that holds them to a higher standard than ordinary citizens because a police officer who loses credibility cannot effectively perform their duty, and, therefore, termination is an appropriate penalty for the grievant's dishonest report that he removed the prisoner for her safety.</p>
<p class="continued">The City says there is no evidence of disparate treatment because there was only one other case of determined untruthfulness by a police officer, and he resigned.</p>
<p class="continued">For these and other reasons, the City asks the arbitrator to deny the grievance.</p>
<h4 align="left"><i>Union:</i></h4>
<p class="continued">The Union asserts that the City, acting with retaliatory <i>animus</i>, embellished unfounded charges of dishonesty, motivated by the June 2015 incident in which the grievant was dispatched to the wrong address where a former Chief's wife pulled a knife on him and was arrested. An internal affairs investigation exonerated the grievant of misconduct in this incident.</p>
<p class="continued">In support of its allegations the City was improperly motivated in its disciplinary decision in the grievant's termination, the Union points to news reports that Captain Grainger said the grievant and his partner were &ldquo;toxic&rdquo; and, other officers on the force would not have had to make an arrest. The also Union points to the Chief's reference to the June 2015 incident to the Mayor in his request that she convene a civil service hearing on charges stemming from the February 2016 arrest.</p>
<p class="continued">The Union reviews the facts of the February 2016 arrest, and argues that eyewitness accounts corroborate the grievant's report that he removed his prisoner for her safety and also to photograph her at the request of the store manager.</p>
<p class="continued">Store Manager D'Amour was not interviewed by Lieutenant Grady's internal affairs investigation of the grievant. Mr. D'Amour testified at arbitration that, before she was removed from the car, the prisoner was irate, kicking and screaming racial slurs at the grievant.</p>
<p class="continued">The Union says that the store security officer testified that the prisoner was extremely aggressive before the grievant removed her from the car.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="continued">Rather than conduct a thorough and objective inquiry of a fellow officer, the facts reveal that every negative inference was drawn against Eason. A shoddy and incomplete investigation led to the denial of critical exculpatory evidence from two eyewitnesses &hellip; An honest and complete reading of Ea-son's report also shows that the Department deliberately parsed portions of it out of context in an effort to create the appearance of lack of candor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">According to the Union, the screaming and kicking by the prisoner in the back of the car, and the request by the store manager to photograph her, happened, &ldquo;simultaneously and independently of each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="continued">The Union argues that the grievant's report details the request by the store to photograph the prisoner and why he decided to remove her from the car.</p>
<p class="continued">The Union alleges the Chief's <i>animus</i> towards the grievant stems from the fact that he was threatened with a lawsuit after the June 2015 ar-rest. The Union points to the Chief's letter to the Mayor referencing the June 2015 incident, even though he knew when he wrote it that the grievant was exonerated in the internal affairs investigation. The Union also notes that the Chief never investigated or disciplined Captain Grainger for defaming the grievant.</p>
<p class="continued">The Union analyzes the &ldquo;Douglas &ldquo;factors&rdquo; from a 1981 federal Merit Systems Protection Board case.<ftnote num="2"><para><italic>Curtis Douglas v. Veterans Administration</italic>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 305-306 (1981)</para></ftnote></p>
<p class="continued">One factor is the nature of the offense in relation to the employee's duties, whether it was intentional or inadvertent. In this case, the Union notes that the discharge was solely based on untruthfulness of the reason the grievant gave for removing the prisoner from his car, and that no charges were pursued concerning his use of force.</p>
<p class="continued">The grievant's past discipline record is considered. The Union reiterates that the June 2015 arrest was used against the grievant even though he was exonerated.</p>
<p class="continued">Consistency of penalty with other employees is a factor for which the Union submits three cases to show disparate treatment of the grievant.</p>
<p class="continued">The Union says the City failed to prove that any discipline was justifiable, let alone termination.</p>
<p class="continued">As remedy, the Union asks the arbitrator to reinstate the grievant with back pay and benefits, including overtime and details, with interest.</p>
<h4 align="center"><b><i>OPINION</i></b></h4>
<p class="continued">This case involves the termination of a 20-year police officer, with a record of prior discipline, for three words written in an arrest report, that the City alleges were untruthful, and that the grievant admits were inaccurate.</p>
<p class="continued">Resolution of the just cause issue presented for arbitration involves deciding whether the grievant was guilty of intentionally lying, and, if so, whether the penalty of discharge was appropriate under all of the circumstances.</p>
<p class="continued">The City's hearing officer found the reason the grievant reported for removing his prisoner from the car was inconsistent with the evidence. The City charged the grievant with conduct unbecoming a police officer, untruthfulness, and falsifying records, based on the reason the grievant reported for removal of the prisoner, expressed in three words: &ldquo;for her safety&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="continued">The grievant acknowledges that he removed the prisoner to enable the store to photograph her, according to practice. He also asserts that the prisoner had been out of control in the back of the car before she was removed, but not immediately prior to her removal. The grievant denies that he lied, implicitly, because she was thrashing and they needed to photograph her, fairly simultaneously.</p>
<p class="continued">The only other dispute concerns the prisoner's level of agitation in the backseat of the car before she was removed by the grievant to be photographed. The grievant reported that she was thrashing about, whereas the City asserts there was no evidence of this, and the lack of movement of the car on surveillance video suggests it was untrue.</p>
<p class="continued">The grievant reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="continued">Shortly after being placed in the back of my cruiser, &lsqb;the prisoner&rsqb; began thrashing her body around in the back seat, yelling that she didn't steal anything, and repeatedly calling me a &ldquo;fucking dumbass&rdquo;. For her safety, I attempted to remove &lsqb;the prisoner&rsqb; from my vehicle and place her onto the ground to control her body.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The report &ldquo;also&rdquo; states that the store wanted a photograph of the prisoner, as part of its process.</p>
<p class="continued">During the internal affairs investigation, the grievant acknowledged that he removed the prisoner to allow the store to photograph her, because she was moving her head around in the back of the car. The grievant testified at arbitration that he removed the prisoner in order for the store to photograph her.</p>
<p class="continued">He also acknowledged during his investigatory interview and at arbitration that the prisoner should not have been taken out of the car to be photographed.</p>
<p class="continued">The hearing officer concluded that the grievant knowingly and purposely falsified the report to protect himself. There were no charges resulting from the grievant's use of force.</p>
<h4 align="left"><b><i>Analysis</i></b></h4>
<p class="continued">There are two main questions to answer: Was the concededly inaccurate phrase, &ldquo;for her safety,&rdquo; intentionally false? If so, was termination an appropriate penalty, under all the circumstances?</p>
<p class="continued">The grievant points out that the prisoner thrashed about uncontrollably in the back of the grievant's police car, suggesting that her safety was also in his mind. The City argues that the grievant intentionally falsified the report, citing circumstantial evidence.</p>
<p class="continued">Although not determinative, I need to resolve the dispute about whether the prisoner thrashed about in the back of the car, as the grievant reported, and which Mr. D'Amour corroborated, or whether the asserted absence of movement of the car in the video and inability to see any movement in back through the windows on the videos, supports the conclusion that the prisoner's behavior was under control before she was taken from the back of the car.</p>
<p class="continued">There is persuasive evidence that the prisoner acted up in the back before she was removed because both the grievant and Mr. D'Amour, the store manager, described kicking and screaming by the prisoner in the back of the grievant's car, before she was removed. Mr. D'Amour was not interviewed during the Departmental internal investigation, and the store security officer, Mr. Agustynowicz, was not asked about the pris-oner's behavior in the back of the car before her removal for the photograph during his interview. Based on the grievant's and Mr. D'Amour's testimony, I conclude that the prisoner was thrashing about in the back of the car before she was removed.</p>
<p class="continued">Nonetheless, after watching all the videos, listening to the audios, and considering the investigative reports and testimony at arbitration, there really is no question that the grievant's report that he took the prisoner out of the car for her safety, was knowingly inaccurate.</p>
<p class="continued">The grievant is a literate writer who fully described the arrest. His use of the phrase, &ldquo;for her safety,&rdquo; was not a result of error or sloppiness. His memory was fresh.</p>
<p class="continued">Therefore, I believe the grievant wanted to conceal the real reason for removing the prisoner by falsely reporting that it was safety-related, and that the reason for this was the public disturbance that resulted when he removed, photographed and returned the prisoner to his car. The grievant should have waited to take the photograph outside public view at the station. He could have gotten assistance from his nearby colleague. I believe the grievant referred to safety to deflect the readers of his report away from his bad judgement. This intentional inaccuracy violated the grievant's obligation to be absolutely truthful.</p>
<p class="continued">However, there are mitigating circumstances and considerations that, ultimately, reduce the seriousness of the offense.</p>
<p class="continued">In his mind, the grievant may have believed his misdirection better justified removing the prisoner, than for a photograph. It was true that the prisoner thrashed about in the back of his car before she was removed.</p>
<p class="continued">The grievant may have considered removing the prisoner for her safety before he removed her from the back, because of her out of control conduct in the back of the car, and he may even have also considered her safety when he removed her, however much that stretches credulity and common sense.</p>
<p class="continued">I conclude that the three words at issue were untrue, intentionally misleading, and cause for discipline, but less than intentionally <i>false</i>.</p>
<p class="continued">Having found the grievant guilty of misconduct, I turn to the question, was the penalty of termination appropriate under all of the circumstances?</p>
<p class="continued">Since the grievant's most recent discipline was the warning level on the City's scale of progressive discipline, he was not subject to termination for another act of misconduct. Therefore, the City must persuade me that the grievant's misconduct was so serious that it justified termination without prior, corrective discipline.</p>
<p class="continued">Such misconduct is considered a &ldquo;capital offense&rdquo; in the employment context because it is the most serious penalty that ends the employment relationship. The classic capital offenses are theft, violence, dishonesty and gross insubordination. The question here is, were the grievant's misleading three words the sort of dishonesty that justifies discharge?</p>
<p class="continued">The grievant's honest conduct after writing those three words throws light on his moral makeup, and leads me to conclude that he was not so dishonest that he deserved termination.</p>
<p class="continued">It is most significant that the grievant immediately admitted to Lieutenant Grady during his internal affairs interview that he removed the prisoner for a photograph, and not for her safety. Even more fundamentally, the grievant readily acknowledged that he should not have removed the prisoner from his car at all. He did the same in testimony at arbitration, although he suggested that safety was a reason to remove the prisoner.</p>
<p class="continued">The grievant also reported that the store wanted a photograph of the prisoner.</p>
<p class="continued">Thus, rather than reporting dishonestly false facts, the grievant misdirected his readers with a subtly false statement that the prisoner was removed for her safety, after her safety may have been in jeopardy from uncontrolled conduct in the back of the car while handcuffed.</p>
<p class="continued">Reports suggest the prisoner may have been addicted to narcotics, which might explain some of her behavior. The grievant knew the prisoner from school, and as a police officer, and he did not appear provoked by her racial slurs.</p>
<p class="continued">The grievant's bad judgment and use of force was investigated, but no charges resulted. The Department's prisoner transport policies were changed shortly thereafter.</p>
<p class="continued">I have to consider that the June 2015 arrest may also have factored into the decision to fire the grievant since he was exonerated by the internal affairs investigation,<ftnote num="3"><para>The second investigation that the Chief assigned to himself does not change the fact that the grievant was exonerated in the first investigation. There is no evidence that the exoneration was rejected or overturned by the Chief.</para></ftnote> yet: the Chief referred to it in his letter to the Mayor recommending termination of the grievant; the grievant's partner the night of the June 2015 incident has a discrimination complaint pending against the City; the Chief was threatened with a civil suit over the incident. Therefore, residual bad feelings between the Chief and the grievant may have, however slightly, affected the Chief's decision to terminate the grievant.</p>
<h4 align="left"><b><i>Conclusion</i></b></h4>
<p class="continued">I was not persuaded that the grievant's misconduct was a capital offense in the employment context, for several reasons.</p>
<p class="continued">First, the grievant told the truth to investigators, and at arbitration, admitting he removed the prisoner for a photograph, and that it was a mistake.</p>
<p class="continued">Second, other employees with similar misconduct received less harsh discipline, or none at all.</p>
<p class="continued">Third, the Chief's decision may have been affected by bad feelings about the grievant because of the June 2015 incident.</p>
<p class="continued">Fourth, I believe that a 20-year officer, like the grievant, can be rehabilitated and retrained so that his future reports will be accurate</p>
<p class="continued">Finally, there were no charges against the grievant about his use of force.</p>
<p class="continued">Therefore, I find that the seriousness of the grievant's admitted inaccuracy was not so dishonest that it was a capital offense, and, therefore, there was no just cause to terminate the grievant for three misleading words in his arrest report.</p>
<p class="continued">Nonetheless, the misleading report was a serious offense that calls for progressive discipline. The grievant received a three-day suspension in 2011, and, more recently, warnings. Therefore, I will return him to the three-day suspension level of progressive discipline.</p>
<h4 align="left"><b><i>Remedy</i></b></h4>
<p class="continued">As remedy, I will direct the City to convert the grievant's discharge to a three-day suspension, reinstate him, and make him whole for lost benefits and wages under the Agreement, including overtime and details, minus interim earnings and unemployment benefits, if any, plus legal interest.</p>
