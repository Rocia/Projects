<p>CITY OF MOORHEAD And LAW ENFORCEMENT LABOR SERVICES INC., LOCAL 69</p>
<p>Arbitration Case</p>
<p>BMS Case No. 16PA0739</p>
<p>May 7, 2017.</p>
<p>Paul Gordon, Arbitrator</p>
<h4 align="center"><b><i>ARBITRATION AWARD</i></b></h4>
<p>The City of Moorhead, Minnesota, herein the City or Employer, and Law Enforcement Labor Services Inc., Local 69, herein the Union, are Parties to a collective bargaining agreement which provides for the final and binding arbitration of certain disputes. The Union filed a request with the Minnesota Bureau of Mediation Services for arbitration of a grievance concerning tuition reimbursement denied by the City to one of its members, Officer Trenton Bachman, herein the Grievant. The Parties selected Paul Gordon to serve as Arbitrator. Hearing in the matter was held in Moorhead, Minnesota on March 8, 2017. No transcript was prepared. The Parties filed written briefs an arguments and the record was closed on March 30, 2017.</p>
<h4 align="center"><b><i>ISSUE</i></b></h4>

<p align="center">&ast; &ast; &ast;</p>
<h4 align="center"><b><i>BACKGROUND AND FACTS</i></b></h4>
<p>Grievant is a patrol officer for the City of Moorhead, Minnesota and a member of the Union. The Union has approximately 48 members who are police officers. As of 2014 the Police Department had approximately 71 FTEs, and in 2015 approximatley75 FTEs. Grievant has an Associate of Arts degree in Criminal Justice. While at Community and Technical College he found that he appeared eligible to be hired as a patrol officer with the City if eligible for POST licensing with an A.A. degree. He reviewed a recruiting brochure from the City Police Department which listed tuition assistance as an attractive benefit offered to police officers. After getting his degree he worked for a North Dakota County Sheriff's Office as a Deputy Sheriff for several months before being hired by the City of Moorhead as a patrol officer in April 2012.</p>
<p>Grievant is a highly motivated police officer who wishes to pursue a career in law enforcement. He has participated in numerous mandatory and optional training programs provided by the Police Department and has been a field training officer for new officers. He wants to and has <i>pursued further</i> formal education working towards a Bachelor degree related to law enforcement by taking courses at two colleges in Minnesota while working as a police officer. The reimbursement for those courses' tuition, fees and books are at issue in this case.</p>
<p>Moorhead is a City with a population of about 42,000 and growing. From 2011 to 2015 the population grew approximately 8.2&percnt;. Calls for service during the same period increased from 28,981 to 37,944 or 30.93&percnt;. Also during that time 24 officers were hired to fill police officer position vacancies and two new positions created as a result of population and geographical growth of the City. All the newly hired officers required training and the use of field training officers, often with added overtime costs to the Department.</p>
<p>The City budget and budgets for each department are generally established by the City Manager, Finance Director and the City Council. Department heads, including the Chief of Police Ebinger, have some input into the process but little, if any, decision making on the overall budget. Chief Ebinger has at least informally requested tuition reimbursement for recent budgets. The Police Department budget contains items for mandatory training, among other things. In the last eight years there has not been any funding for tuition reimbursement for police officers, and there has been no tuition reimbursement to patrol officers in eight years. In 2008 the department did reimburse tuition for two support staff who are not police officers and are not in the bargaining unit. Prior to 2006 the department averaged about &dollar;20,000.00 in tuition reimbursements. In 2007 the department spent approximately &dollar;5,356.86 in tuition reimbursements. The Chief of Police has the discretion to spend from different parts of the Police Department budget even if such spending is not in accordance with the line item budgets set by the City. For example, in 2015 the department spent over 128&percnt; of its mandatory training budget; in 2014 it spent 145&percnt; of its training budget. The City has included tuition reimbursement funding in budgets for other departments during the past several years, particularly for the Fire Department. The Fire Department has not been spending all of its budget on general training and has roughly half as many FTEs as the Police Department.</p>
<p>The Parties' collective bargaining agreement on tuition reimbursement has a course approval provision &ldquo;for courses approved by management&rdquo; which has been in place since 1993. A provision that reimbursement &ldquo;may be approved&rdquo; has been in place since 2008. In 2009 there was a grievance by a bargaining unit employee over the denial of a request for tuition reimbursement, and the language on course approval and payment was the same as in the instant case. That grievance went to arbitration in 2011 before Arbitrator Jeffrey Jacobs and the grievance was denied therein. The Arbitrator found, among other things, that there is no limiting language on the City's right to establish a budget and what to fund and what not to fund as a result of the language in the course approval provision. The Award also found there had been no arbitrary or capricious City decisions or actions as to tuition reimbursement. After that Award was issued, in bargaining for the current contract there was no proposal to limit management's discretion relating to tuition reimbursement.</p>
<p>The City has a general policy on educational assistance which, since revised in 2012, has provided:</p>
<blockquote><p class="continued">The City of Moorhead encourages its employees to enroll in job-related educational programs and may provide financial assistance. Job-related educational programs must be taken from accredited institutions of higher learning or vocational-technical schools. Department directors determine whether or not a course is job-related and must approve the educational course prior to the beginning of any course. Requests can be approved only if your department has unencumbered funds within their budget to accommodate the request.</p></blockquote>
<p align="center">&ast; &ast; &ast;</p>
<p class="continued">The Chief of Police is generally supportive of police officers pursuing educational programs and higher degrees in law enforcement for professional advancement. The Chief also prioritizes maintaining public safety services with increases in population and calls for service, the mandatory training for officers generally and mandatory training and equipping of new officers and, specialized training for department programs - in the face of underfunded training budgets. The Chief has denied courses when there have not been funds within the budget or unencumbered contingency funds.</p>
<p>On August 6, 2015 Grievant submitted a request for educational assistance form and required documentation for tuition reimbursement for two courses at Metropolitan State University and on course at Minnesota State University. The request was forwarded to and reviewed by the Chief. The Chief meet with Grievant and told him there were no budget funds for reimbursement. The Chief indicated he would seek budget funding from the City for tuition requests. The next day he denied Grievant's request in writing stating: &ldquo;Denied due to budget considerations. Tuition reimbursement is not possible at this time.&rdquo; The Chief did request funding in discussions with the City Manager, but the next years' police department budget did not contain funding for tuition reimbursement.</p>
<p>Despite the denial of approval for the proposed courses, Grievant took and completed the Fall 2015 classes earning all As. On December 17, 2015 he submitted a revised request for education assistance form along with supporting documents which requested reimbursement for tuition and books for two of his three classes in the amount of &dollar;2, 034.04. One of the requested classes turned out to be unnecessary.</p>
<p>On December 22, 2015 the Chief denied the request and sent an email to grievant which stated:</p>
<blockquote><p class="continued">Again, I must decline this request in that we are already over-budget in out (sic) Training Budget and do not have funds to reimburse tuition.</p>
<p class="continued">Should we negotiate the ability for me to approve partial reimbursement and I am able to get a line item in future budgets I will be willing to consider future requests.</p>
<p class="continued">Having said that I want to congratulate you on a pretty impressive GPA and let you know that I really respect your efforts to advance your knowledge and abilities in our field. Having finished my BA and obtained my MA while working I know it is no easy task but I can assure you it will serve you well in the future.</p>
<p class="continued">I will keep you informed of any developments in this area.</p></blockquote>
<p>On January 4, 2016 the Union filed a grievance over the December 22, 2015 denial of Grievant's December 17, 2015 request for reimbursement. The Union reasoned that Grievant was not eligible for reimbursement until he had satisfactorily finished the classes and before then he had not suffered any losses. The grievance stated:</p>
<blockquote><p class="continued">I am filing a step-1 grievance based on being denied tuition reimbursement as defined in Article 29 of L.E.L.S. Local 69 labor agreement.</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The grievance was denied on January 11, 2016. The Union pursued the grievance through the grievance process referencing the December 22, 2015 denial of the request and it requesting reimbursement for tuition, fees and books and to be made whole. At step 2 it was denied on the basis that &ldquo;tuition reimbursement will only be paid for courses approved by management. The approval of these courses may be a function of a number of factors, including but not limited to the availability of funding in the department budget.&rdquo; At step 3 it was denied on the basis that &ldquo;It is clear in this provision that the City as (sic) an unrestricted management right to approve tuition reimbursement.&rdquo; This arbitration followed.</p>
<p>In the meantime Grievant continued to pursue his degree and on November 16, 2015 he had submitted another request for education assistance for the Spring semester of 2016, which was denied by the Chief on November 16, 2015 &ldquo;due to budget constraints.&rdquo; Grievant submitted requests for subsequent semesters which were similarly denied on April 14, 2015, July 25, 2016 and December 29, 2016. His total requests for tuition reimbursements are approximately &dollar;8,800.00. The last three denials also noted that the issue is currently in or under mediation, or that it was in arbitration.</p>
<p>Further facts are as set out in the Discussion.</p>
<h4 align="center"><b><i>POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES</i></b></h4>
<h4 align="left">The Union</h4>
<p>In summary, the Union argues that the benefit of Article 29 tuition reimbursement would be rendered meaningless by allowing the City the unilateral option to not budget for it. The Parties understood the tuition reimbursement Article would have some application, yet it has not been funded for almost a decade. If the Article is not applied to Grievant's pursuit of a degree here then the City will likely never budget for or permit that benefit to any police officer. This cannot be the intent behind Article 29.</p>
<p>The Union argues that the City reads the 2011 Jacobs Arbitration Award far too broadly. There the Arbitrator recognized the City's budget was stressed, and that Award must be viewed in light of that. He wrote, &ldquo;Obviously different facts may well yield a different result, but here, the City showed by persuasive evidence that their budget was limited and that the City made a decision based on that not to provide tuition reimbursement at this time.&rdquo; There are critical differences in the facts currently before the Arbitrator than were before Jacobs, chiefly the much improved financial condition of the City.</p>
<p>The Union argues that the Jacobs Award stated &ldquo;if there had been evidence that the City acted in an arbitrary, discriminatory or capricious fashion in denying this particular officer's request, the result may have been different but no such evidence was presented here.&rdquo; In Grievant's case here there was evidence that the denial was arbitrary and capricious. As of March 2017 the Department continued to hold out to the public, through its <i>webpage</i>, tuition assistance as an attractive benefit to its police officers as an incentive. Grievant saw a similar brochure before applying with the City. It is arbitrary and capricious to use tuition assistance to attract job candidates where it has not provided that benefit to a police officer in nearly a decade, while all other attractive benefits listed are regularly provided.</p>
<p>It is arbitrary and capricious to claim budgetary inability where the evidence shows the Department made virtually no effort to obtain such funding. Chief Ebinger's efforts were informal and not a serious attempt to secure funding. When tuition reimbursement was not in the following budget he simply acquiesced and did not follow up or renew the request. The City Manager did not testify to confirm the request and it is unclear if the City Manager recognized a request had been made or had come to an informed decision to deny it. There is no evidence the City Manager was informed of Article 29. Chief Ebinger's casual pursuit of tuition reimbursement was arbitrary.</p>
<p>The Chief acted simply as a conduit with no evidence as to why the request for budgeting was denied. It is arbitrary and capricious for the City to justify not funding the benefit in the Parties' contract as due to budgetary limitations when it provides no evidence the decision maker was aware of the request or denied it for budgetary reasons, In both 2016 and 2017 the City budgeted &dollar;6,000.00 to the Fire Department for tuition reimbursement in a total 2016 Fire budget of &dollar;3,987,367.00. In 2016 the Police budget was &dollar;10,227,974.00. A similar percentage towards tuition reimbursement would be over &dollar;15,000.00. Grievant's requests were over three years and such an amount could easily have been covered by the City. It is arbitrary and capricious for the City to claim a budgetary inability to fund tuition reimbursement for the Police Department when at the same time is has funds to do so for the Fire Department. It seems the Fire Department was not utilizing all its training budget so funds were earmarked for tuition. This raises the issue of why the City choose not to apply any surplus fund to the unfunded Police Department if it could fund Fire tuition requests through budgeted training funds. If Chief Ebinger was advocating for tuition one would expect the City Manager would have seen this option. There is no testimony from the City Manager as to his awareness of the Police need for tuition funding or why Fire was funded but not Police.</p>
<p>The Union also argues that the City attempted to limit the Arbitrator's review to only the Fall 2015 request for reimbursement and that the grievance was untimely since it should have been filed after the Chief's response to Grievant's August 6, 205 request. The City argument is disingenuous because until Grievant satisfactorily completed his fall 2015 coursework he had not suffered any loss and, the City never raised timeliness until the arbitration. Allowing a grievance to move from step to step without objections of untimeliness can be deemed waived, citing arbitral authorities. The City attempt to limit review to 2015 is a way to avoid justifying the &dollar;6,000.000 for Fire tuition in 2016 and 2017. Since Grievant completed his fall 2015 courses in December it is unlike his request could have bene processed by the end of 2015. And there is no reason he had to be paid out of the 2015 budget. If money was there for tuition in the 2016 and 2017 Fire budgets, it is illogical to conclude the City cannot afford to do so for Police. The 2017 Police budget decreased by &dollar;64,303.00 from 2016 to 2017. Why did the City not utilize some of that decrease to fund tuition reimbursement?</p>
<p>The Union further argues that the City faults the Union for failing to separately grieve its declining to pay Grievant's later requests for reimbursements in 2016 and 2017. These were not separately grieved because the Union reasonably believed the Parties recognized the resolution of the Fall 2016 matter would control resolution of the subsequent occurrences. In those the Chief specifically noted the issue is currently under mediation and in arbitration. Thus, the City anticipated the instant case would control treatment of the subsequent requests.</p>
<p>The Union argues that the later requests and their denials are in the nature of a continuing violation. Each denial was based on the same City argument that it has no obligation to budget for tuition reimbursement. More on point would be an implied waiver. Parties' actions may constitute an implied waiver even though no formal agreement has been reached, citing arbitral authority. The Chief's repeated comment that the issue was in mediation or arbitration also indicates recognition that the issue was being addressed in those forums and subsequent requests would be resolved on the basis of this award, citing arbitral authority.</p>
<p>The Union also argues that in the prior Jacobs Award the Arbitrator there distinguished the case of <small-cap>City of St. Mary's PA, and Officers of the City of St. Marys</small-cap>, 113 LA 708 (<small-cap>Talarico</small-cap>, 1999). In light of current circumstances the language of <small-cap>St. Marys</small-cap> is directly relevant. That Award stated:</p>
<blockquote><p class="continued">Moreover, it appears the City anticipates paying for any educational reimbursement from its &ldquo;training&rdquo; budget. If the City intends on co-mingling requests for post-secondary educational classes with requests for routine training, then it must be amenable to spending some of this money for post-secondary educational classes. The City cannot deny all post-secondary educational classes simply because it decides its training budget is to be totally devoted to traditional such as fingerprint identification, crime scene analysis, etc., which are obviously more directly relevant to an Officer's duties. Nor, can the City deny all requests for tuition reimbursement for post-secondary educational classes by simply not budgeting any money at all. That would be an absolute abuse of discretion.</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Id. at 711-712.</p>
<p class="continued">This analysis should apply here. The City includes its tuition reimbursement fund in the training budget. Since the City did not separately budget for tuition reimbursement the Chief claims he has no funds to grant requests. As in <small-cap>St. Marys</small-cap>, the &ldquo;right to train employees has absolutely no relationship to the educational benefits.&rdquo; (Id. p. 711) The City obligation to provide POST training is separate from its Article 29 obligation. The implied covenant of good faith would instruct that the City's approval must be applied reasonably. A claimed budgetary inability to pay and expressed benefit lasting nearly a decade belies good faith.</p>
<p>The Union argues that as long as the City never separately budgets for tuition, it believes it can never have an obligation to do so. The ability to budget for tuition reimbursement is broader than what the City decides to allocate in the training budget. Funds for tuition can come from anywhere. With improved financial conditions, adding a minimal percentage increase to the police budget would easily cover Grievant's request and the evidence indicates the City could afford to do so. The City had funds in 2016 and 2017 to budget for tuition reimbursement for the Fire department. This is compelling evidence it could also do so for the Police Department. All agree the City is in better shape than it was at the time of the Jacobs Award in 2011. The City has not chosen to allocate funds for tuition. It is arbitrary to allow the City to choose not to budget for tuition reimbursement for police and then claim the lack of an expresses budget dictates that it cannot afford to provide the benefit. The Jacobs Award should not be used to justify never budgeting for tuition.</p>
<p>The Union requests that the grievance be granted and the City directed to reimburse Grievant for his tuition, fees and books for the 2015, 2016, 2017 semesters he requested.</p>
<h4 align="left">The City</h4>
<p>In summary, the City argues that the City has an unequivocal management right to budget and approve courses for tuition reimbursement. The Minnesota Public Employment Labor Relations Act and Articles 5 and 29 of the Labor Agreement provide management the right to budget and approve courses for tuition reimbursement. Arbitrator Jacobs affirmed management's right to budget for tuition reimbursement as matter of overall budget under M.S. 179A.07. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p class="continued">The clause &ldquo;approved by management&rdquo; contains no limitation in its whatsoever and would seem to convey the clear meaning that the approval of courses that qualify for tuition reimbursement is subject to management's discretion. This is further supported by the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in the second sentence of Article &lsqb;29.1&rsqb;. The remainder of the article refers to the rate at which the reimbursement is to be made but the initial decision about whether or not to even approve the course by a cursory review of the language rests with management.</p>
<p class="continued">p. 17</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The City clearly exercised its management right to deny Grievant's request based on budgetary constraints.</p>
<p>The City argues that it complied with the Labor Agreement in denying Grievant's request for tuition reimbursement. The Union has the burden to prove a violation of the Labor Agreement and it has failed to meet its burden. In interpreting labor agreements decision makers first look to the language of the contract and examine extrinsic evidence of intent only if the contract is ambiguous on its face, citing arbitral authority. The Labor Agreement here has Zipper and Waiver clauses providing extrinsic evidence cannot be considered in interpreting the agreement. Certain principles apply: language must be given its plain and ordinary meaning; a labor agreement term must be read in the context of the entire labor agreement so as not to lead to a harsh and absurd result, and; a labor agreement should be interpreted to give meaning to all its provisions, citing arbitral and legal authority. These principles support the City's position that the City complied with the Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>The plain language of the Labor Agreement clearly provides that the Employer may approve or deny tuition reimbursement. Arbitrators apply the &ldquo;plain meaning rule&rdquo; to consider that if a single, obvious and reasonable meaning appears in the language of a contract, that meaning should be applied, citing arbitral authority. Article 29 plainly states that tuition reimbursement is only available for &ldquo;courses approved by management&rdquo;. The payment provision states that reimbursement &ldquo;may be approved.&rdquo; The plain language can only be reasonably interpreted to mean that management has the discretion to approve courses and pay for reimbursement.</p>
<p>The Union's interpretation of the Labor Agreement would lead to a harsh and absurd result. Even if ambiguous, the Employer's interpretation would lead to a reasonable result. The contract language requires the City to provide tuition reimbursement only if a course is approved by management. The Union argues, in effect, that the City is required to provide tuition reimbursement for courses not approved by management and that the City cannot deny courses in certain circumstances. This is harsh and absurd. This is contrary to the clear language of the contract. It imposes limitations on the City right to approve or disapprove courses. It would result in money taken from mandatory training for all personnel and reallocate to a few people for discretionary schooling. It would be a legal and operational detriment to the department and the City would be required to budget for a discretionary, not a mandatory, benefit.</p>
<p>Giving effect to all words and construing the LaborAgreement as a whole supports the City's position that the tuition reimbursement provision provides management's right to approve courses for reimbursement. Words in a contract are presumed to have meaning. The inclination is to choose the interpretation that would give effect to all provisions and contract interpretation require a disputed provision of a contract to be read in light of the entire agreement, citing arbitral authority. Article 29 is the only employee benefit in the entire agreement that requires management approval before the benefit incurs to the employee. With other benefits management does not have discretion to approve or deny the benefit by the terms and conditions of the contract. This lends strength to the interpretation that the course approval provision was intentionally included in Article 29 as an important element of the tuition reimbursement provision. The provision was clearly intended to have meaning and provide management discretion in the particular issue. The Union's interpretation that management cannot exercise discretion to refuse to approve courses eligible for tuition reimbursement would render the words of the provision entirely meaningless.</p>
<p>The City also argues that the principal purpose of the course approval provision is to retain management's right to approve courses. Arbitrators agree that an interpretation in tune with the purpose of a provision is to be favored over one that conflicts with it, citing arbitral authority. The purpose of the course approval provision here is to provide management the right to determine which courses to approve for reimbursement. The Union argues the City must approve any course that the City was required to budget for tuition reimbursement and, the City was limited in factors it could consider before approving courses. These arguments are contrary to the clear contract language. The provision must be interpreted to mean that the City had the right to budget for and approve or deny courses without any limitations.</p>
<p>The City further argues that extrinsic evidence supports its position in this matter. Though irrelevant because of the clear contract language, extrinsic evidence also supports the City. Citing the Minnesota Supreme Court and the United States Supreme Court in the &ldquo;Steelworkers Trilogy&rdquo;, the power of an arbitrator is defined as:</p>
<blockquote><p class="continued">(A)n arbitrator is confined to interpretation and application of the collective bargaining agreement; he does not sit to dispense his own brand of industrial justice. He may of course look for guidance from many sources, yet his award is legitimate only so long as it draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement.</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">In the Fall of 2014 the Parties began negotiating a new labor agreement and the issue of tuition reimbursement was not raised by the Union. The Union never proposed or indicated the City must approve or budget for tuition reimbursement. The Parties reached agreement on the new labor contract maintaining language identical to previous contracts addressing management's unlimited right to approve courses for tuition reimbursement. Bargaining history demonstrates that the language of the Labor Agreement means the City's unlimited right to approve courses for tuition reimbursement.</p>
<p>The City argues that Arbitrator Jacobs' determination in 2011 that approval of courses for tuition reimbursement under the course approval provision is subject to management's discretion controls this matter. When an issue has previously been submitted to arbitration, a new incident involving the same parties and same contract provision but in the absence of materially changed circumstances the new incident may be controlled by the prior award. Arbitrators give contractual language a meaning consistent with a prior award unless the prior award is substantially flawed. Arbitrators have held that awards in the past are deemed incorporated into the labor agreement, particularly when the provision previously interpreted has been carried forward intact into a successor agreement, citing arbitral authorities. The 2011 Award is controlling and is due deference by the Arbitrator here. Both grievances involved identical contract provisions and are based on exceedingly similar fact patterns. Budget restraint were the reasons for denial in both cases. The Union had opportunities to seek changes in the provisions after the 2011 Award and failed to do so. The Jacobs interpretation of the <i>course</i> approval provision supports the City's position.</p>
<p>The City argues that it acted reasonably. Budget constraints clearly supported denial of Grievant's request for tuition reimbursement. Management's right to establish plans, such as policies and budgets, should be reasonable in content and application. A plan ought not to be declared invalid based on the mere existence of some remote possibility that it could operate perversely in the indefinite future, citing arbitral authorities. The December 2015 request was denied by the Chief stating &ldquo;I must decline this request in that we are already over-budget in out (sic) Training Budget and do not have funds to reimburse tuition.&rdquo; The Employers actions were wholly reasonable and complied with the Labor Agreement. In 2015 the Police Department spent &dollar;10,675.60 over the &dollar;37,187.00 it was provided for training, which is 128&percnt; of the budget for training. The Chief was cognizant of the lack of funds when he reviewed Grievant's request. He determined that pursuant to the City education assistance policy the Department did not have unencumbered fund within the budget to accommodate the request. The Chief reasonably and appropriately denied Grievant's request.</p>
<p>Despite being denied tuition reimbursement, the City provides and pays for substantial training for Grievant. In 2014 and 2015 the City provided Grievant with nearly 300 hours of training, most of which was discretionary and well above the average hours provided for other officers, providing him with substantial professional development.</p>
<p>The Police Department's persistent budget constraints justify its inability to fund tuition reimbursement requests. Departments provide minimal input in the City's budget-making process. Additionally, the Police Department faced budget challenges in 2015 due to providing public safety services with an increasing population and a higher number of calls for service, a high number of new patrol officers who required intensive training, and habitual underfunding of the Police Department's training budget. The Union is likely to rely on a 2014 arbitration decision in <small-cap>City OF Isanti and Law Enforcement Labor Services, Inc</small-cap>. where a grievance based on a denial of tuition reimbursement was sustained. The facts there are significantly different and the reasoning in that case is not instructive in this matter. In that case the city stated that it will never approve such a request so long as there exists other training which must be completed. And in that case the denial was due to financial reasons whereby the department is no longer able to budget&mdash;and does not have &mdash; funds to reimburse. The Arbitrator concluded the City has made a decision that it will not approve any college course for reimbursement. The language of the Chief there indicated the employer did not intend to consider tuition reimbursement in the future. This is different from the language in Chief Ebinger's denial of Grievant's request in December 2015 where he clearly conveyed to Grievant that the department could not reasonably approve his request at that time, but that approval in the future was a possibility. And, there was no evidence in the <small-cap>Isanti</small-cap> arbitration regarding city process for budgeting or financial position. In the instant matter there is ample evidence that the Police Department training budget was strained procedurally and substantively in 2015. Since 2011 it had responded to increasing numbers of call for service and to train new officers due to turnover without increase in funding from the City. Expending 128&percnt; of its 2015 training budget is not a case of the City failing to budget for training as apparently argued by the Union. This evidence supports the denial as reasonable and did not constitute a practice of failing to consider any request, as was the case in <small-cap>Insanti</small-cap>. <small-cap>Insanti</small-cap> should be given no weight.</p>
<p>The City complied with the Parties' practice in considering the tuition reimbursement request. Where practice has established a meaning for language contained in past contracts and continued by the parties in a new agreement, the language will be presumed to have the meaning given it by that practice, citing arbitral authority. Before Grievant's December 2015 request the Chief had consistently exercised management rights to approve or deny requests by both approving and denying such requests. Since 1993 Management consistently exercised its discretion to approve or deny requests for course approval. The practice was challenged in the 2011 arbitration and that Award clearly provided management discretion to approve courses. The Parties' practice supports the City position that management has the discretion to approve or deny courses.</p>
<p>Tuition reimbursement in other departments or years subsequent to Grievant's request are irrelevant. The Fire and Police Departments differ in important ways, making the Union's comparisons irrelevant. The Police Department has about 34 more full time employees than the Fire Department. In 2015 the Police Department was allocated &dollar;37,187.00 for training and spent 128&percnt; of that, while in the same year the Fire Department was allocated &dollar;15,789.00 and spend only &dollar;9, 437.10. In 2015 the Fire Department had funds available to fund tuition reimbursement while the Police Department did not have extra funds. The Police Offices must be licensed by the P.O.S.T. Board, which requires at least 48 hours of continuing education every three years. Fire Department employees are not required to meet those extensive training requirements. Regarding after 2015 requests, arbitrators are reluctant to consider post-grievance conduct and instead rely on the facts at the time the grievance occurred, with only a few limited exceptions, citing arbitral authority. The City 2016 and 2017 budgets and actions are not relevant to the issue of whether at the time of the December 2015 denial the City was acting pursuant to management rights.</p>
<p>The City also argues that the Union waived its right to pursue a grievance related to Grievant's request for tuition reimbursement. If a labor agreement contains clear time limits for filing and prosecuting grievances, failure to observe them generally will result in dismissal of the grievance if the failure is protested. Here, Article 7.3 of the Labor Agreement provides a twenty-one (21) calendar day timeline for filing a grievance. Grievant submitted his request for education assistance on August 6, 2015, which was denied on August 7, 2015. He did not initiate this grievance until January 4, 2016, 150 days after the alleged violation. It is well beyond the 21 days required under the Labor Agreement. The grievance is procedurally invalid. Under 7.6 of the Labor Agreement a grievance not presented within the time limits shall be considered waived. Grievant failed to initiate a grievance within the timelines and his grievance is waived, and it should be denied.</p>
<p>The City further argues that the Arbitrator has no authority to award the remedy requested by the Union. Under the Labor Agreement the arbitrator shall have no right to amend, modify, nullify, ignore, add to, or subtract from the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Requiring the City to provide tuition reimbursement without approval of courses by management ignores clear language that reimbursement is only provided for &ldquo;courses approved by management&rdquo; and that financial assistance &ldquo;:may be approved.&rdquo; The remedy the Union requested would add a term and condition that the City would be required to provide tuition reimbursement for any course requested by an employee.</p>
<p>The City requests that the grievance be denied in its entirety.</p>
<h4 align="center"><b><i>DISCUSSION</i></b></h4>
<p>The issue in this case is whether the City violated Article 29.1 of the collective bargaining agreement when it did not approve courses for tuition reimbursement requested by Grievant. The specific language at issue is:</p>
<blockquote><p class="continued">The City shall provide full tuition reimbursement for courses approved by management. Financial assistance for reimbursement of tuition, fees, and required books may be approved for regular full-time employees not in probationary status.</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Grievant was a regular full-time employee not in probationary status at the time he made his request for tuition reimbursement. There is no issue involving the nature of the underlying courses he took. The issue goes to the City's obligation to approve and reimburse for the courses. The City maintains that it has statutory management rights to fund or approve tuition reimbursement or not fund or approve - which are reflected in the collective bargaining agreement in Article 5 and applied in the provisions of Article 29.1 because the courses must first be approved by management and that is a matter of discretion. Similarly, use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in the second sentence makes budgeting and approval discretionary and a matter on management's rights. The City position is that it has no obligation under the collective barging agreement to approve courses or reimburse tuition, fees and books if it chooses not to as a management right, particularly in the face of budget challenges.</p>
<p>The Union maintains that by not budgeting, approving and reimbursing tuition, fees and books the City is in effect rendering Article 29.1 meaningless and is acting in an arbitrary and capricious manner. The Union maintains that Article 29 must be interpreted to have some application here or it will never apply and the benefit will have been effectively eliminated from the contract.</p>
<p>The provisions and language at issue here were the subject of a prior arbitration Award under similar fact circumstances where the City denied tuition reimbursement for a police officer on the grounds of budgetary constraints. In <small-cap>Law Enforcement Labor Services, Local 69 and City of Moorhead, BMS Case no</small-cap>, 10-PA-0733 (<small-cap>Jacobs</small-cap>, 2011) Arbitrator Jacobs found the language on its face supported the City's view.</p>
<blockquote><p class="continued">The clause &ldquo;approved by Management&rdquo; contains no limitation in its whatsoever and would seem to convey the clear meaning that the approval of courses that qualify for tuition reimbursement is subject to management's discretion. This is further supported by the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in the second sentence of Article 28.1. The remainder of the article refers to the rate at which the reimbursement is to be made but the initial decision about whether or not to even approve the course by a cursory review of the language rests with Management.</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Id. p. 17</p>
<p class="continued">The undersigned agrees with Arbitrator Jacobs conclusion that the language is clear and it does provide management the discretion whether to approve or fund tuition reimbursement. And, as stated by Arbitrator Jacobs: &ldquo;Certainly, had the parties intended to place a limitation of the right of the City to use budgetary reasons to limit the approval such language could have been included.&rdquo; Id. p. 17.</p>
<p>PELRA gives the City budgetary discretion by law. The collective bargaining agreement does reserve the management right to budget in Article 5.1. An employer can agree to limit some of its management rights, and that is what the provisions of a collective barging agreement do. Management rights are retained unless limited by the Labor Agreement. Article 29.1 does retain management discretion by use of its conditional language. Nothing in Article 29.1 limits the City's discretion on its face as to approval of courses or reimbursement of tuition.</p>
<p>A prior arbitration Award concerning the same parties, contract language and similar facts is entitled to due consideration and weight. The Parties in a collective bargaining agreement agree to final and binding arbitration of disputes. Arbitration Awards help guide both parties thereafter in applying and interpreting the provisions in an Award. This helps to provide stability, reliability and predictability in the management - labor relationship. Those principles apply here.</p>
<p>The language of Article 29.1 is clear and it does provide the City with the discretion whether to approve courses and the discretion whether to reimburse tuition, fees and books. It does not require the City to do so. The City's denial of Grievant's tuition reimbursement request in this case complied with the clear and plain language of Article 29.1.</p>
<p>The Parties do not argue that the language is ambiguous or that any particular meaning has been attached to the language by them. Thus, there is no need to resort to bargaining history or past practice, if any, in interpreting this language.</p>
<p>But this does not end the interpretation and application of the Article 29.1 provisions. The case is set in the broader context of how the City is applying this clear language and using its discretion.</p>
<p>The Jacobs Award did discuss further the nature of this language and its application:</p>
<blockquote><p class="continued">Accordingly, based on the contractual language that is clear and reserved to the City the discretion to approve these coursed, the bargaining history in this particular instance that demonstrated a clear reservation of those rights by the City and the lack of any agreement to require the City to fund tuition reimbursement or to waive or limit the right to establish its overall budget and the lack of sufficient evidence of any arbitrary, discriminatory or capricious actions by the City directed toward Officer Carlson, the grievance must be denied.</p>
<p class="continued">Id. p. 21.</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The undersigned also agrees that the City must not act in an arbitrary, discriminatory or capricious manner in exercising its discretion on tuition reimbursement funding and approval, even if the language of Article 29.1 favors the City. This brings the case to the core of both Parties arguments. The Union maintains that the City is acting in an arbitrary and capricious manner by not funding or approving tuition reimbursement for eight years, and that is why the City is rendering the provisions meaningless. The City maintains that in exercising its discretion it was not arbitrary or capricious due to continued budgetary pressures, particularly in the Police Department.</p>
<p>The Jacobs Award did discuss budgetary considerations in the context of arbitrariness as a reason to deny the request. &ldquo;Obviously different facts may well yield a different result, but here, the City showed by persuasive evidence that their budget was limited and that the City made a decision based on that not to provide tuition reimbursement at this time.&rdquo; Id. P. 21. Similar budgetary reasons for the denials were given by Chief Ebinger to Grievant in the matter at hand.</p>
<p>The Union argues that a critical difference between this case and the prior Award is that the financial condition of the City is much improved. While the financial condition of the City does appear to have improved, there have been some particular pressures on the Police Department since then. As pointed out by the City, the population has increased from 2011 to 2015 by 8.2&percnt;. At the same time calls for service increased by 30.95&percnt;. This comes at a cost that must be meet by the City and the Police Department and keeps pressure on City and Department finances.</p>
<p>There is also the matter that during the same period there have been 24 vacancies of police officer positions that had to be filled, including adding two new positions to meet the above growth pressures. Filling each of these positions is expensive in terms of training, equipment, time and supervision. It also requires experienced field trialing officers who are sometimes paid at a higher or overtime rate to meet training demands.</p>
<p>The costs of the new police officers keeps pressure on City and Department finances.</p>
<p>The population and calls for service increases along with the costs associated with new police officers are proper matters the City and Police Department to take into consideration when exercising its discretion as to tuition reimbursement. While the overall financial condition of the City may have improved, in some aspects such as these there have been new financial pressures that the City can, and did, consider in exercising its discretion. That is not arbitrary or capricious. It is based on hard financial fact.</p>
<p>The Union maintains it is arbitrary and capricious for the City to use tuition reimbursement as an attractive benefit to recruit officers such as Grievant and then not provide that benefit while it provides all of the other attractive benefits listed in the promotional materials. However, Article 29.1 does contain the discretionary language that is absent in the other benefits. Those are mandatory. Tuition reimbursement is discretionary. The City and Department have reimbursed tuition frequently prior to 2008 and the great recession. The recession took a number of years to rebound from. This accounts for most, if not all, of the financial pressures faced by the City during those years, which are the same years the Union references. This does not show an intent by the City to eliminate a bargained for benefit or make it arbitrary or capricious. Things are financially better now yet new financial stresses have come to bear on the City as mentioned above. The City's promotional material for police recruitment might be phrased differently, but that does not make it illusory. It does not mean that the City will not fund and approve tuition reimbursement going forward.</p>
<p>The Union argues it is arbitrary and capricious to claim a budgetary inability to provide tuition assistance where the evidence shows that the Department has made virtually no effort to obtain such funding. The Union maintains that Chief Ebinger's efforts in that regard do not reflect a serious attempt to secure such funding. However, the Chief did bring the matter to the attention of the City Manager, yet more funds were not budgeted by the City. The Chief in his December 2015 denial did inform Grievant of the possibility of future budgets for tuition reimbursements. The Chief also used his discretion in providing funding for mandatory training in several budgets by spending more than was budgeted for things he was required to do. The undersigned is persuaded that the Chief has been acting in good faith and does support police officers advancing their educations. As to the Union's criticism that the City did not present the testimony of the City Manager, the Union itself could have called the City Manager as a witness to question the nature of the Chief's budget requests and the Manager's reaction. The Union does have the burden of proof and that requires it produce evidence. The City did produce a prima facie showing through the testimony of the Chief that he did seek tuition reimbursement funding. The Union has not shown that the Chief acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.</p>
<p>The Fire Department did receive some funding for tuition reimbursement. The Union contends that it is arbitrary for the City to claim a budgetary inability to fund tuition reimbursement for the Police Department when at the same time it has funds to do so for the Fire Department. This is something like an apples to oranges comparison. The Fire Department has about half the FTEs as the Police Department and it does not have the mandatory POST ongoing training expense the Police Department has. The Fire Department has not been spending all of its budgeted training accounts whereas the Police Department has been spending over 100&percnt; of its training accounts for several years. These differences are a real distinction in Departments. Each has different financial pressures and priorities. That the Fire Department obtained about &dollar;6,000.000 for tuition reimbursement does not mean that the City and Police Department acted arbitrarily in denying Grievant's requests.</p>
<p>The evidence does not show that the City and Police Department acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner in exercising its discretion not to fund or approve tuition reimbursement for Grievant. The City did not violate Article 29.1 by denying the request in an arbitrary or capricious manner.</p>
<p>The Union also argues that in the prior Jacobs Award the Arbitrator there distinguished the case of <small-cap>City of St. Mary's PA, and Officers of the City of St. Marys</small-cap>, 113 LA 708 (<small-cap>Talarico</small-cap>, 1999). The Union argues that in light of current circumstances the language of <small-cap>St. Marys</small-cap> is directly relevant. That Award stated:</p>
<blockquote><p class="continued">Moreover, it appears the City anticipates paying for any educational reimbursement from its &ldquo;training&rdquo; budget. If the City intends on co-mingling requests for post-secondary educational classes with requests for routine training, then it must be amenable to spending some of this money for post-secondary educational classes. The City cannot deny all post-secondary educational classes simply because it decides its training budget is to be totally devoted to traditional such as fingerprint identification, crime scene analysis, etc., which are obviously more directly relevant to an Officer's duties. Nor, can the City deny all requests for tuition reimbursement for post-secondary educational classes by simply not budgeting any money at all. That would be an absolute abuse of discretion.</p>
<p class="continued">Id. at 711-712.</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The Union maintains that the Jacobs Award distinguished this case, and that the analysis employed in <small-cap>St. Marys</small-cap> should apply to the instant case. However, the distinguishing factors in the Jacobs Award also apply to this case. As he explained, in <small-cap>St. Marys</small-cap> the City actually had set aside money for courses and it was the way the City denied the reimbursement which was arbitrary and capricious. The case was decided on quite a different issue than presented in the Jacobs Award and the instant case. Arbitrator Jacobs stated: &ldquo;The <small-cap>St. Marys</small-cap> case should not be read as a blanket pronouncement that any City anywhere abuses its discretion when it finds it cannot fund a discretionary program like this in times when budgets are stressed and cuts are being made to accommodate that.&rdquo; Id. p. 21. He further stated: &ldquo;As noted, PELRA reserves such decisions to the public employer and unless there is a clear contractual obligation requiring that certain courses be approved there is no absolute requirement that the City fund the program.: Id p. 21. While the budgetary stresses faced by the City in 2015 and 2016 are not as grave as in prior years, there were still unusual financial stresses on providing police services as noted above. It seems particularly unusual to need to hire and train 24 police officers, about half of the police patrol officers in the Departments positions, from 2011 through 2015, And, the Chief has made some effort to obtain funding for tuition reimbursement even if that has not been successful. The Union argues that the lack of funding for tuition reimbursement for eight years is rendering Article 29.1 meaningless. But this time period does cover a good deal of the recovery from the great recession and the growth and officer replacement pressures followed that. This does not mean that the City can forever avoid tuition reimbursement simply by not budgeting for it. But in the instant case it was not arbitrary or capricious for it to deny the request. The undersigned is not persuaded that the circumstances here are the same as in <small-cap>St. Marys</small-cap>, and the passage relied on by the Union does not require approval or funding for Grievant's request.</p>
<p>The Parties did take issue with each other as to whether the City's financial condition in 2016 and 2017 should be considered. The Union contends this information shows the City continues to improve its financial situation or is at least not as stressed as it had been in 2011, and that rather than fund tuition reimbursement in 2017 the City actually reduced the Police budget by &dollar;64,303.00 from 2016. The Union argues that the grievance here is in the nature of a continuing violation and a continuing grievance given the denials in 2016 and 2017 for the same reason and the Chief's notation therein that the issue was in mediation or arbitration. The Union also argues that the City waived its objection by the Chief's noting in the subsequent denials that the issue was in mediation or arbitration. The City argues that these years are irrelevant to the issue of whether a tuition reimbursement denial in December of 2015 was proper. In this case it was the denial of the December 2015 request that went through the grievance process. Neither Party mentioned a continuing violation or continuing grievance in their grievance writings. No new grievances were filed for the subsequent denials. There is no evidence or arguments that the Parties agreed that the January 4, 2016 grievance would be determinative of any subsequent tuition reimbursement requests, although the Union assumed that. As argued by the City, it is recognized that arbitrators are reluctant to consider post-grievance conduct of the parties at arbitration, and instead rely on the facts at the time the grievance occurred. <small-cap>Elkouri &amp; Elkouri</small-cap>, <small-cap><italic>How Arbitration Works</italic> (8th ed</small-cap>. 2016). When the grievance here was filed the financial condition and budgets for 2016 and 2017 were not available or relied on by either party in making the funding decisions and the decision to grieve the 2015 denial. Nothing that happened after the grievance was filed changed the facts as they existed when it was filed. Yet, the financial condition of the City in 2016 and 2017 does have some bearing on the directing the City finances had been in from 2015 and prior that. Grievant made a request on December 17, 2015, almost at the end of the year. The direction of City finances is relevant in considering the City arguments that it was still experiencing budget challenges due to population growth, increased calls for service and new officer training needs. The 2016 and 2017 financial information is relevant to the arguments of the Parties. Even if it is considered that the Fire Department received tuition reimbursement budgets in 2016 and 2017, as actually discussed above, that circumstance does not alter the result on the merits. The City did respond to the Union arguments about the Fire Department budgets. City budgets and financial conditions in 2016 and 2017 do not render its 2015 denial of Grievant's tuition reimbursement request arbitrary, capricious or a violation of Article 29.1.</p>
<p>There is a procedural issue raised by the City in its arguments. It contends that the grievance here is untimely and therefore waived because the original denial of Grievant;'s request for course approval was on August 7, 2015. The grievance was not filed until January 4, 2016, after Grievant's December 17, 2015 request for reimbursement was denied on December 22, 2015. Article 7.3 of the Labor Agreement has a twenty-one (21) calendar day limit to file a grievance after such alleged violation has occurred. Article 7.6 deems a grievance not filed within the time limits shall be considered &ldquo;waived.&rdquo; The Union counters that Grievant had not suffered any damages before the December request and that was when he had finished the courses. The Union also contends the City waived this procedural objection by not bringing up the issue until arbitration. Tuition reimbursement has two parts. Article 29.1 requires that courses be approved. The City does not pay up front. It reimburses, so a request must be made with necessary information to actually get the reimbursement for courses that have been approved. The undersigned is persuaded that the City did waive its timeliness argument, regardless of the merits of the Union's damages argument. As noted by the Union, arbitration is not the place to raise timeliness issues for the first time. <small-cap>Elkouri &amp; Elkouri</small-cap>, <small-cap><italic>How Arbitration Works</italic> (6th ed</small-cap>. P. 219). In none of the City's written responses to the grievance steps or in any other evidence is it shown that the City made a timeliness objection before the arbitration proceedings. Arguments over an issue might change and be refined during a grievance process, but bringing up a timeliness objection after the grievance has already proceeded through its steps is a different matter. The grievance is not time barred.</p>
<p>The City complied with Article 29.1 when it denied Grievant's request for tuition reimbursement in December of 2015. It did not act arbitrarily or capricious when it made the denial of the request. It has not acted arbitrarily or capriciously by not budgeting or making tuition reimbursement available for Grievant's request. The City did not violate Article 29.1.</p>
<p>Accordingly, based on the evidence and the arguments of the Parties, I issue my</p>
<h4 align="center"><b><i>AWARD</i></b></h4>
<p class="continued">1. The grievance is not time barred</p>
<p class="continued">2. The grievance is denied and dismissed. No remedy is ordered.</p>
