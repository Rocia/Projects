<p>TEAMSTERS UNION, LOCAL 760, Union, vs. DARIGOLD, INC., Employer.</p>
<p>Arbitration Case</p>
<p>FMCS No. 160913-57896-6</p>
<p>Kenneth James Latsch, Arbitrator</p>
<p class="continued">Teamsters Union Local 760 (Union) and Darigold, Inc. (Employer) selected Kenneth James Latsch from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service Dispute Resolution Panel to decide a grievance concerning the discharge of Victor Tom (Grievant), a bargaining unit employee. A hearing was conducted in Sunnyside, Washington on February 23, 2017.During the course of the hearing, the parties presented witnesses and documentary evidence to support their respective positions before the Arbitrator. The parties submitted post-hearing briefs on April 7, 2017. The briefs were received in a timely manner, and with the receipt of the briefs, the hearing was closed.</p>

<h4 align="center"><b>BACKGROUND</b></h4>
<h4 align="left"><i>The Employer's Operation</i></h4>
<p class="continued">Darigold operates several milk processing plants in Washington State. Darigold's Sunnyside, Washington facility produces milk powder, whey and cheese. The Sunnyside plant employs approximately 150 employees. The Employer has a collective bargaining relationship with Teamsters Union, Local 760 for a bargaining unit described in the parties' June 8, 2016 through September 15, 2019 collective bargaining agreement as:</p>
<blockquote><p class="continued">&hellip;any and all production employees (including Group leaders), warehouse employees, laboratory, shipping, and receiving employees employed by the Employer at its Sunnyside, Washington facility, excluding all office clerical employees, engineering (maintenance) employees, retail store, quality control manager, guards, supervisors, and other salaried employees as defined in the National Labor Relations Act.</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Events leading to the instant grievance arose in the Employer's milk powder operation in the Sunnyside plant. Approximately 15 employees work in the Sunnyside facility's milk powder plant. The Employer sells milk powder for use in a variety of consumer products, including chocolate bars and baby formula. John Kochis has served as the Milk Powder Plant Manager since January 2016. Brett Downing served as Milk Powder Plant Manager prior to Mr. Kochis, and he also served as the Quality Assurance Manager for five years prior to his service as plant manager.</p>
<p class="continued">The Milk Powder Plant produces its product through the use of a sophisticated drying process. Milk Process Operators must run production equipment and continuously monitor for safety and appropriate product quality. Dryer Operators perform the same general function for the milk powder being produced.</p>
<h4 align="left"><i>Work in the Milk Powder Plant</i></h4>
<p class="continued">Victor Tom, the Grievant in this matter, started working with Darigold in March, 2011. When the Sunnyside Milk Powder Plant started operation in January 2015, Mr. Tom was one of the four process operators assigned to work there. The four operators, Mr. Tom, Freddy Avila, Alfredo Maldonado, and Albert Cruz, received specialized training on the new plant's operation from the vendors and manufacturers responsible for installing the new equipment. The training included classroom sessions and &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; practice with production and monitoring devices that would be used in the drying process. Under Mr. Downing's supervision, the plant began producing powdered milk and other products shortly after its start-up.</p>
<p class="continued">The Milk Powder Plant operators must monitor and operate the various machines used in the drying process, including separators, evaporators, and various silos, pipes and connections. To start the process, an operator selects a silo to draw raw milk from. The raw milk is processed through separators where cream is separated from skim milk. Skim milk is further processed by going through a membrane to separate milk proteins and excess water. Some of the skim milk goes through a separate operation to produce &ldquo;codex&rdquo; milk powder. To be produced, a compound referred to as permeate is added to the powdered milk product. The operator must select the permeate silo to add material to the milk powder, and permeate cannot be added without action from the production line.</p>
<p class="continued">The milk powder product goes through an evaporator to be pasteurized and to have additional water removed. The product then goes through a dryer and is produced into its final milk powder product.</p>
<p class="continued">Computers are located throughout the Milk Powder Plant. They are used to select which silos should be used to draw milk product into the production process, to start and stop production equipment and to monitor the product as it flows from one point to another. Each computer displays several &ldquo;tabs&rdquo;, or screens, to monitor and operate specific production functions. The system is designed to allow an operator to perform work throughout his/her area of responsibility while continuously monitoring the flow of milk product through the milk powder process. Operators routinely use the computer to monitor production every 15 to 30 minutes. However, there is no set protocol on how often the computers must be checked.</p>
<p class="continued">Operators must also &ldquo;walk their lines&rdquo; to make sure that product is flowing through the milk powder process within expected parameters. The operators visually inspect the silos, connections, valves and other production equipment within their areas of responsibility. In addition, operators routinely feel the temperature of the pipes that move the powdered milk product through the various production stages. The operators know that a cold temperature means that the product is flowing without obstruction.</p>
<p class="continued">Operators also make visual inspections and they listen to the equipment to determine if any problems can be detected. Operators must know where the product is flowing from and where it is flowing to at all times during their work shifts. Generally speaking, the operators' chief responsibilities rest with equipment and product monitoring. The operators are expected to understand how to keep their areas of concern operating smoothly to keep production at specified levels while guaranteeing that the need for loss prevention is kept low.</p>
<p class="continued">Apart from monitoring duties, operators have a number of secondary responsibilities, such as cleaning their work areas and production equipment. Operators take samples of milk product and check readings on a variety of equipment used in the powder milk process. Readings are typically taken from the same computers used to monitor production, and are tracked to determine whether the product meets required specifications.</p>
<h4 align="left"><i>The Grievant's Employment at Darigold</i></h4>
<p class="continued">Victor Tom (Grievant) began employment with Darigold in March 2011. During his time with the company, Mr. Tom worked in several production positions, and he was part of the start-up team when the Milk Powder Plant started operation in January 2015. Mr. Tom enjoyed working at the plant and often volunteered for overtime work. At all times pertinent to this matter, Mr. Tom was part of the bargaining unit represented by the Union.</p>
<p class="continued">Mr. Tom had a complicated employment history with Darigold. In December 2015, Mr. Tom received a written warning for watching a football game on his cell phone during work hours and for leaving his work area during regular shift hours without permission. Also in December 2015, Mr. Tom was given a verbal warning for pumping two incompatible chemicals into the same 55 gallon drum, creating nitric acid fumes. The Sunnyside Fire Department had to respond to the incident to ventilate the area.</p>
<p class="continued">On February 9, 2016, Mr. Tom received written warning and suspension because he failed to wear safety glasses while cleaning his area of responsibility. When a supervisor told Mr. Tom to put the glasses on, he complied, and finished the work to be done. The Employer believed that the violation was serious, and was part of a pattern of inattention. Accordingly, a one shift suspension was imposed along with a written warning.</p>
<p class="continued">On February 27, 2016, Mr. Tom did not check a circuit on a silo that was to be cleaned. Because of Mr. Tom's error, cleaning fluid was released onto the production line floor. This caused delay in milk processing and additional costs to clean the area correctly. On March 11, 2016, the Employer issued a written warning along with notice that this would be considered a &ldquo;last and final&rdquo; warning for Mr. Tom. In part, the warning directed Mr. Tom that he &ldquo;must remain in his work area and ensure all of his equipment is performing properly&hellip;&rdquo; In addition, the warning stated that &ldquo;&hellip; if performance is not corrected, next disciplinary action will be: Termination of your employment with Darigold&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 align="left"><i>The Incident Leading to the Instant Discipline</i></h4>
<p class="continued">On July 22, 2016, Mr. Tom was working the day shift in the Milk Powder Plant, from 6:00 AM to 6:30 PM. At approximately 9:30 AM, Mr. Tom made a routine check on a computer monitor. However, the computer screen &ldquo;grayed out&rdquo;, and Mr. Tom could not see anything on the screen. Mr. Tom immediately asked for assistance from IT staff member Jason Woody. Mr. Woody looked at the computer and tapped the gray screen with his finger. He finally rebooted the computer and it came back online. Mr. Tom reviewed the computer screen, looking for alarms that would indicate that there was a catastrophic equipment failure that would shut down production. Mr. Tom did not check the computer for information about where product was being pulled from, or what silo was being engaged.</p>
<p class="continued">Mr. Tom did not see any alarms, so he proceeded to the evaporator area to clean. He cleaned that area for the next two and one half hours. At approximately 12:30 PM, the dryer supervisor told Mr. Tom that it appeared that the milk powder was being contaminated with whey, a wheat product. Mr. Tom was surprised, and then checked the computer screen to see what the status of production was. He discovered that whey was being introduced into the product, rather than permeate, which was the appropriate additive. Whey was kept in a separate silo and was not to be used for milk processing.</p>
<p class="continued">Mr. Tom immediately found Mr. Kochis to tell him about the situation. Mr. Tom pulled Mr. Kochis out of a meeting to inform him that whey had gotten into the milk production process. Mr. Tom explained that he had difficulty with the computer screen and that he got assistance from the IT department. Mr. Tom further explained that the IT staff member, Mr. Woody, had tapped the computer screen while it was still &ldquo;grayed out&rdquo;. Mr. Tom speculated that Mr. Woody may have switched the silos when he tapped the computer screen, but he could not be sure.</p>
<p class="continued">The contaminated product could not be sold for its intended use and could only be used for animal feed. Mr. Kochis testified that the incident cost almost &dollar;29,000 in lost product, in addition to lost production time.</p>
<h4 align="left"><i>The Employer's Investigation</i></h4>
<p class="continued">Mr. Kochis investigated the July 22, 2016 incident. He had already heard Mr. Tom's version of events when he was notified of the event by Mr. Tom. Mr Kochis also spoke with Mr. Woody, who confirmed that an issue had taken place with the computer monitor. Mr. Kochis also reviewed production information, and determined that permeate stopped flowing at the time that Mr. Woody worked on the computer monitor, and that whey immediately entered the production system. The production information further showed that whey continued to be pumped through the system until 12:30 PM.</p>
<p class="continued">Mr. Kochis researched the possible causes for the switch from permeate to whey. He concluded that the switch could have occurred because of an intentional act by someone with access to the computer control system; because of an accidental switch; or because of a system error. Mr. Kochis decided that the most likely situation was an accident caused when Mr. Woody tapped the computer screen while it was still &ldquo;grayed out&rdquo;, where he inadvertently switched silos while the system was operational.</p>
<p class="continued">Mr. Kochis did not fault Mr. Tom for the cause of the incident. Mr. Tom did not have anything to do with the switching of silos. However, Mr. Kochis was very concerned that Mr. Tom did not monitor his equipment, thus allowing the mistake in production to continue for several hours.</p>
<p class="continued">Mr. Kochis met with Mr. Tom again on July 22 or 23, 2016 in Arasele Isquiedro's office. Ms. Isquiedro was the Employer's Human Resources Manager at the Sunnyside facility. Mr. Kochis asked Mr. Tom to go through the events that took place when the production issue arose. Mr. Tom stated that he looked at the computer after Mr. Woody did his work, but stated that he did not look at which silo was feeding material into the production system. Mr. Kochis also spoke with Mike Smith from the IT office. Mr. Smith could not replicate the situation described by Mr. Tom, nor could he identify any particular error in the computer system that would allow a switching of silos.</p>
<p class="continued">Mr. Kochis reviewed the entire situation and determined that discharge was appropriate. Mr. Kochis was aware of Mr. Tom's prior disciplinary actions and was also aware that he was working under terms of the &ldquo;last and final warning&rdquo; from the March 2016 discipline. On July 27, 2016, Mr. Tom was discharged from employment with Darigold. The Union filed a grievance on Mr. Tom's behalf, and the matter proceeded through the grievance procedure in a timely manner.</p>
<h4 align="center"><b>POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES</b></h4>
<h4 align="left"><i>The Employer</i></h4>
<p class="continued">The Employer argues that it had just cause to terminate Victor Tom from employment. The Employer contends that the Grievant failed to monitor the production process in an acceptable manner, and that he was fully aware of his duty in this regard. The Employer notes that the Grievant's actions caused serious monetary loss and production delay and could have been avoided if he did his job correctly. The Employer asserts that the Grievant was not based on the switching of silos, but it was directly related to his failure to monitor the production line in a timely manner. The Employer maintains that it conducted a full and fair investigation into this matter, and that discharge was the appropriate penalty for the infraction involved here.</p>
<h4 align="left"><i>The Union</i></h4>
<p class="continued">The Union argues that the Employer did not have just cause to terminate Victor Tom. The Union contends that the underlying problem was created inadvertently by the IT staff member when he checked on a faulty computer terminal. The Union maintains that the Grievant was performing his assigned duties, and that he reported the problem as soon as he discovered it. The Union contends that the Employer violated Article 10.1 of the parties' collective bargaining agreement when it terminated the Grievant because it failed to provide him a written warning of similar deficiencies before termination could be imposed. The Union notes that the Employer did not provide such a warning in this case, thus making the termination invalid. Finally, the Union argues that discharge is too severe of a penalty in this case. The Union contends that the Grievant tried to address a problem in the production line, and that the problem was made worse because of the IT employee's actions. The Union maintains that the Grievant acted in good faith and did not attempt to &ldquo;cover up&rdquo; the situation. Given the unique set of factors presented here, the Union concludes that termination was not appropriate.</p>
<h4 align="center"><b>ANALYSIS</b></h4>
<p class="continued">This discipline must be analyzed in the context of the just cause standard. Arbitrator Carroll Daugherty created the just cause standard for employee discipline in 1964. In <i>Enterprise Wire Co.</i>, 46 LA 359 (Daugherty, 1966) Arbitrator Daugherty explained the necessary elements of just case as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p class="continued">1. Was the employee adequately warned about the consequences of his/her conduct?</p>
<p class="continued">2. Was the employer's rule or order reasonably related to efficient and safe operations?</p>
<p class="continued">3. Did the employer investigate before imposing discipline?</p>
<p class="continued">4. Was the investigation fair and objective?</p>
<p class="continued">5. Did the investigation produce substantial evidence or proof of guilt?</p>
<p class="continued">6. Were the rules, orders and penalties applied evenhandedly and without discrimination?</p>
<p class="continued">7. Was the penalty reasonably related to the seriousness of the offense and the past records?</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">As the moving party in a disciplinary case, the Employer bears the burden of proof. <i>Vista Chemical Co.</i>, 104 LA 818 (Nicholas, Jr., 1995). In meeting its burden of proof, the Employer must show that the elements of just cause were satisfied for the particular disciplinary act taken. The Employer must establish each element of just cause with evidence &ldquo;indicating that the thing to be proved is highly probable or reasonably certain&rdquo;. <i>HyVee Food Stores</i>, 102 LA 555 (Berquist, 1994). If the Employer cannot meet its burden of proof, the Arbitrator must grant the grievance.</p>
<p>As Arbitrator David Gaba stated in <i>Clearwater Paper Corp.</i>, 132 LA 465 (Gaba, 2013), just cause is often described as a &ldquo;broad and elastic concept, involving a balance of interests and notions of fundamental fairness&rdquo;. I addressed the application of the just cause standard in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote><p class="continued">It must be emphasized that arbitrators have rejected a mechanical application of all seven tests of just cause in every case involving discipline. It is more important to focus on the elements of the just cause test that may be at issue in a particular case. Just cause must be viewed as an analytical tool to allow examination of disciplinary action while inhibiting the need to interject personal opinions or beliefs into the situation.</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued"><i>Mead School District</i>, 135 LA 398 (Latsch, 2015).</p>
<p class="continued">Arbitrators insist that just cause is based on the principle that an employer applies well established work rules in a fair and even-handed manner, and that an affected employee has adequate notice of the rules and the consequences of a failure to follow them. Finally, the punishment must fit the act that brought about discipline. As stated in <i>Boeing Company</i>, 132 LA 252 (Landau, 2013), an employer must be sure that it &ldquo;complied with all applicable procedural requirements including the norms of industrial due process commonly followed by labor arbitrators&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 align="left"><i>Was the employee adequately warned about the consequences of his/her conduct?</i></h4>
<p class="continued">The record clearly shows that the Grievant was aware of his duties as an operator and the consequences of poor performance. The Employer presented credible evidence that it provided extensive training on the Powder Milk Plant operation. The Grievant was one of the original operators when the facility opened and received training from experts who made and installed the new equipment.</p>
<p class="continued">The Grievant also had earlier discipline that dealt with inattention to detail on the production line. The Employer provided him several warnings that his performance had to be improved. However, the Grievant did not improve his behavior, leading to the instant grievance. It is important to note that the prior discipline all involved types of inattention, so each discipline dealt with the same general problem presented in this case. Given all of the information presented to me, I must conclude that the Grievant was adequately warned about the consequences of his actions.</p>
<h4 align="left"><i>Was the employer's rule or order reasonably related to efficient and safe operations?</i></h4>
<p class="continued">The Union properly notes that there was no specific work rule that mandated how often an operator had to check the computers in his area of responsibility. The Union maintains that the Employer cannot impose discipline on the Grievant based on a standard of performance that could be changed on a case-by-case basis. The Employer argues that it should be allowed to write general rules that do not attempt to cover every step in powder milk production, and that the operators on the line have adopted an acceptable schedule to check their equipment.</p>
<p class="continued">This conclusion was affirmed by testimony from several of the Grievant's co-workers. The co-workers each testified that they inspected their computer screens about every 15 to 20 minutes, and that they believed that such an interval was reasonable to keep track of the production in their particular work areas. In this case, the Grievant did not check the computer for several hours.</p>
<p class="continued">I find that the Grievant's coworkers provided very compelling evidence concerning their monitoring duties. Each employee explained that they checked computer monitors every 15 to 20 minutes, and that they believed that such regular monitoring was necessary to make sure that production was proceeding correctly. Therefore, the Employer's general work rules and the accepted application of those rules give context for the instant grievance.</p>
<h4 align="left"><i>Did the employer investigate before imposing discipline?</i></h4>
<p class="continued">In this case, the investigation took place very quickly after the incident was reported. As soon as the Grievant informed him of the situation, Mr. Kochis reviewed the chain of events that took place. The underlying problem was easily identified. A contaminating substance was introduced into the milk powder being processed. While the substance was not toxic, it was incompatible with the powder milk product being processed at the time. More importantly, the contaminating substance continued to be introduced for several hours. Production records clearly showed what happened and the duration of the problem.</p>
<p class="continued">The cause of the problem required serious evaluation. Mr. Kochis reviewed the situation with the Grievant, with members of the IT team and with several of the Grievant's co-workers. He then discussed the matter with the Employer's human resources office. Mr. Kochis conducted an investigation that was commensurate to the incident involved in this matter. I must conclude that the Employer did conduct an investigation in this matter.</p>
<h4 align="left"><i>Was the investigation fair and objective and did the investigation produce substantial evidence or proof of guilt?</i></h4>
<p class="continued">It is not enough to have conducted an investigation. The Employer must have conducted a fair and objective investigation into the matter. In this case, the Union challenges the Employer's investigative process, arguing that it was too short and unfocused. The Union further maintains that the Employer did not acknowledge that the primary problem arose because of a mistake that was made by an IT employee, not the Grievant.</p>
<p class="continued">The Employer argues that its investigation was reasonable and objective. The Employer maintains that Mr. Kochis reviewed all necessary information before a decision to impose discipline was made, and that he only imposed discipline after considering the seriousness of the events involved.</p>
<p class="continued">I have reviewed the record and the arguments made by the parties, and I must conclude that the Employer conducted an appropriate investigation. The investigative process disclosed that the Grievant did not, in fact, cause the whey to be introduced into the powder milk production process, and that the accident was the result of the IT employee's inadvertent actions at the &ldquo;grayed out&rdquo; computer screen. The investigation further disclosed that the extent of the problem was traced back to the Grievant's failure to monitor the computer screen in a timely manner. By neglecting to monitor the computer, the whey flowed into the milk powder process for hours, when it could have been cut off in minutes. The investigation clearly showed how the situation developed and how the Grievant's actions made the situation worse.</p>
<h4 align="left"><i>Were the rules, orders and penalties applied evenhandedly and without discrimination and was the penalty reasonably related to the seriousness of the offense involved?</i></h4>
<p class="continued">The final issues to be addressed deal with the application of discipline and consideration of whether the discipline was too severe. The Union argues that the Employer did not appropriately impose discipline because it did not provide a written explanation of the matter first. The Union notes that the collective bargaining agreement calls for a written notification, and that the Employer simply did not comply with terms of the contract. The Union further argues that discharge is too severe a discipline in this case, particularly since the precipitating event was caused by another employee, not the Grievant.</p>
<p class="continued">The Employer contends that a separate written notification is not necessary in this case, since the Grievant was working under terms of a &ldquo;last and final&rdquo; agreement that had been in existence for several months before this grievance arose. The Employer argues that in such an event, it was unnecessary for another warning document since the Grievant had already been warned about the consequences of further disciplinary matters. As to the severity of the discipline, the Employer maintains that discharge was the only appropriate course of action given the events described here and the Grievant's disciplinary history of inattention to duty.</p>
<p class="continued">I have reviewed the parties' arguments and I conclude that the Employer did not violate any contractual provisions when it imposed discipline in this case. The Grievant was working under terms of an existing &ldquo;last and final&rdquo; document, and the Employer did not have to remind the Grievant of his employment obligations again before imposing discipline. The Employer gave the Grievant a chance to correct earlier disciplinary problems, but he did not take the opportunity. I am convinced that the Grievant did not set out to cause a problem for the milk powder production, but his inattention to his duties led to a very serious problem that cost the Employer money in lost product and in lost production time. Given the Grievant's past employment issues, it appears that the immediate case is a continuation of an overall lack of concern for the details of his work. The Employer could no longer count on the Grievant to do his work properly, and chose to discharge him. I believe that the Employer's decision is supported by the facts presented here.</p>
<h4 align="center"><b>AWARD</b></h4>
