<h4 align="center"><small-cap>Opinion and Award</small-cap></h4>
<h4 align="center"><i>INTRODUCTION</i></h4>
<p>This arbitration proceeding was conducted pursuant to Article 15 of the May 1, 2013 <i>Labor Agreement by and between North Hills Toyota and District Lodge No. 98, Local Lodge 1060 International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers</i>. Hearing was held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on February 16, 2017. At the hearing, sworn testimony was taken with the Parties being provided an equal opportunity to examine and cross-examine witnesses; exhibits were offered and made part of the record. Both Parties submitted Post Hearing Briefs.</p>
<h4 align="center"><i>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</i></h4>
<p>The Grievant was suspended and subsequently discharged from employment for falsifying records and refusing to cooperate in the Company's investigation. The Union grieved the suspension and discharge as being in violation of the Parties' Collective Bargaining Agreement. The grievance was processed, without resolution, through the steps of the Parties' contractual grievance procedure, and the matter is now before this Arbitrator for final and binding determination.</p>

</blockquote>
<h4 align="center"><i>DISCUSSION</i></h4>
<p>Robert Killmeyer, North Hills Toyota Service Director, explained that the Dealership maintains a large service department with as many as twenty-five to twenty-eight service technicians. The Dealership is licensed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to perform state emissions tests and vehicle inspections, and the Dealership must adhere to state mandates in that regard. More than a thousand such inspections may be performed in a month, and when a full inspection is conducted, the Technician enters data into the testing device and that data is communicated directly to the state over a dedicated phone line.</p>
<p>Ryan Kavanagh, Service Consultant, testified that when a customer presents a vehicle for a state emissions test and vehicle inspection, he copies the customer's insurance card and vehicle registration, obtains other relevant information, performs an inspection of the vehicle, including a check of the vehicle's mileage, and notes the information on a Work Order. The Work Order is given to a Shop Dispatcher, who, in turn, passes the Work Order along to a State Inspection Technician.</p>
<p>When a State Inspection Technician brings in his own vehicle, or a relative's vehicle, Mr. Kavanagh typically does not see the vehicle. Frequently, the vehicle is already in the shop, and the Technician will present the documentation to Mr. Kavanagh, and inform him of the vehicle's mileage. Mr. Kavanagh then prepares the Work Order. If he does not have the mileage at the time the Work Order is prepared, a place holder of 99999 in inserted into the mileage block of the form. The actual mileage is later inserted at the conclusion of the process when Mr. Kavanagh prepares the Invoice.</p>
<p>The Grievant was a Master Diagnostic Technician, which is Toyota's highest grade of Technician, and was employed in this Dealership since it was purchased by North Hills Toyota in approximately 2007. The Grievant has been with Toyota for a total of thirty-eight years.</p>
<p>On August 18, 2016, the Grievant brought his mother-in-law's sixteen-year old Buick to the Dealership for emissions testing. The Grievant provided the insurance card and registration to Mr. Kavanagh, but indicated that he did not have the mileage. Mr. Kavanagh began creating a Work Order, using 99999 as the mileage place holder. After dealing with customers that were awaiting his attention, Mr. Kavanagh proceeded into the service area on another matter and also took the paperwork to provide to the Grievant. Mr. Kavanagh, not seeing the Grievant but seeing the Buick in the Grievant's service bay, obtained the vehicle's mileage and wrote the mileage of 108,532 above the 99999 place holder on the Work Order. The Work Order was left with the vehicle.</p>
<p>That afternoon, the Grievant returned the Work Order to Mr. Kavanagh. While preparing the Invoice, Mr. Kavanagh noted that the 108,532 mileage he had written above the 99999 place holder had been scratched out, and that a mileage of 104,610 had been written on the Work Order by the Grievant, along with a notation that indicated the vehicle was exempt from an emissions inspection.</p>
<p>For a vehicle to be exempt from an emissions inspection, the vehicle must have been driven less than 5,000 miles over the previous twelve months. Mr. Kavanagh, having access to the vehicle's history, noted that the reported mileage from the previous year was 99,987. With the mileage of 104,610 as written by the Grievant on the Work Order, and transmitted to the Commonwealth as the vehicle's mileage, the vehicle was exempt from emissions inspection. However, with the actual mileage of 108,532, it was not.</p>
<p>At that point, Mr. Kavanagh presented the information to Mr. Killmeyer, along with the vehicle's mileage history. This occurred late in the day, and Mr. Killmeyer proceeded into the shop. Mr. Killmeyer was unable to locate the vehicle or the Grievant, whose work day had concluded. Because of the ramifications of misreporting emissions inspection data to the Commonwealth, Mr. Killmeyer notified his superiors of the incident.</p>
<p>The following day, August 19, Mr. Killmeyer emailed the Grievant's Union Representative, Kevin Hallam, requesting that he, along with the Grievant, participate in an investigatory meeting. Mr. Hallam was unable to report to the Dealership, but agreed to participate via speakerphone. Present in the meeting were Mr. Hallam via phone, Mr. Killmeyer, the Grievant, and Gary Skutnik, Company Controller.</p>
<p>Mr. Killmeyer explained the circumstances leading to the meeting, stressed the gravity of the situation, and stated that he was conducting an investigation into the matter. Mr. Killmeyer recalled that the Grievant was seated directly across from him, and that he requested the Grievant return the car to the Dealership for the odometer to be inspected. The Grievant responded that he would not, that it was an invasion of his privacy. In that the Grievant would not cooperate in the investigation, Mr. Killmeyer ordered the Grievant home, with instructions not to return while the investigation was ongoing.</p>
<p>In addition to submitting what appeared to be falsified mileage to the Commonwealth, after the Grievant was sent home on August 19 he engaged in problematic behavior in an attempted cover-up. Mr. Kavanagh testified that the Grievant unexpectedly appeared at his residence, and requested that he, Mr. Kavanagh, sign a document indicating he did not report a mileage inconsistency to Mr. Killmeyer. Mr. Kavanagh declined to execute the document.</p>
<p>Moreover, a week or two after being sent home, Mr. Killmeyer was contacted and advised that the Grievant had information that would put this matter to rest. A meeting was held between the Grievant and Mr. Killmeyer. Mr. Hallam was also in attendance, as was Mr. Skutnik. At the meeting, the Grievant claimed that the transmission of his mother-in-law's vehicle had failed, and that the vehicle had been scrapped. In support of that contention, the Grievant offered supporting documentation at the meeting, and again at the arbitration hearing.</p>
<p>At the arbitration hearing, the Grievant testified that on Thursday August 18, after performing the inspection and upon returning the car to his mother-in-law, the transmission began slipping. On Saturday, the Grievant continued, he inspected the vehicle and found that the transmission had failed, resulting in the car being scrapped.</p>
<p>To establish the mileage of the vehicle at the time it was scrapped, the Grievant presented a receipt from a salvage yard and a copy of the title to his mother-in-law's vehicle. The back of the title the Grievant presented contained a handwritten mileage of 104,000. The Grievant testified that the secretary at the salvage yard had written the mileage on the title.<ftnote num="1"><para>The Grievant also produced other documentation at the arbitration hearing, however, the documentation produced lacked any probative value in establishing the mileage of the vehicle on August 18, 2016.</para></ftnote></p>
<p>The secretary from the salvage yard, the person responsible for intake of vehicles to be scrapped, testified that when someone presents a car to be scrapped, the owner signs the back of the title, granting ownership to the salvage yard. The secretary identified the title to the mother-in-law's vehicle as a copy of the title from her files, however, it was established that the back of her copy of the title does not contain an entry for the mileage. The secretary explained that when a car is being scrapped, mileage is not entered.</p>
<p>When questioned on cross-examination regarding the discrepancy between the title he presented and the title on file at the salvage yard, the Grievant had no explanation. Additionally, salvage yard records disclose that the car was not crushed until September 3, and, as the Employer points out, the Grievant could have gone to the salvage yard prior to that date and photographed the odometer. The Employer had previously indicated to the Grievant that a photograph of the odometer would have been acceptable.</p>
<p>It was admitted by the Grievant that, as Mr. Kavanagh testified, mileage recorded for vehicles belonging to a Technician's relative is entered based on the Technician's representation. The mileage representation made by the Technician is not checked by the Service Consultant in every instance. The Grievant acquiesced that over the years his mileage representations were not verified by the Service Consultant, until last year. Thus, as the Employer argues, it can be presumed that the Grievant expected his misrepresentation to go unchallenged.</p>
<p>Based on the evidence of record, it has been established that the Grievant misrepresented the mileage of his mother-in-law's vehicle to avoid emissions testing. It was also established that the Grievant attempted a cover-up through falsification of other documentation and the attempted suborning of false information through Mr. Kavanagh.</p>
<p>By letter dated September 1, 2016, the Grievant was discharged from employment. Mr. Killmeyer testified that emissions inspections are an important part of the Employer's business, and that the Grievant's misrepresentation to the Commonwealth caused the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation to issue the following admonition to the Employer:</p>
<blockquote><p>&hellip; &lsqb;I&rsqb;t is requested that you adhere to the applicable inspection regulations, as any future infraction of these regulations may cause the suspension of your inspection privileges.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Employer cannot be expected to risk an important part of its business to a Technician who not only misrepresents mileage to the Commonwealth, but also attempts to conceal the misrepresentation by engaging in the above-noted attempted cover-up. In the view of the Arbitrator, notwithstanding the Grievant's long tenure as a Toyota Service Technician and his having reached the highest classification of Technician at Toyota, evidence of record establishes that any trust the Employer is capable of placing in the Grievant has been lost. The Employer had Just Cause, as mandated by Article 2, and Good and Sufficient Cause as indicated in Article 13, Paragraph 13.1, for the termination of the Grievant's employment.</p>
<h4 align="center"><i>CONCLUSION</i></h4>
<p>Based upon the foregoing, the above identified issue is answered in the affirmative. The Employer had Just Cause, as mandated by Article 2, and Good and Sufficient Cause as indicated in Article 13, Paragraph 13.1, for the termination of the Grievant's employment. It follows that there is no violation of the parties' Collective Bargaining Agreement, and the grievance is denied.</p>
